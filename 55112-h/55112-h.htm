<h3>III.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FRANKS AND MEROVINGIANS.</span></h3>

<p>After the fall of the Western Empire the Franks step into
the foreground and show themselves of all the German tribes
the most capable of founding a stable government. From the
first they were distinguished from the others by their superior
military discipline, and by their pride and ambition. They had
always been looked upon as formidable warriors. Few of them
wore helmets and mail; their breasts and backs were covered
only by the shield. From the hips downward they wrapped
themselves in close-fitting linen or leather, so as to display each
man’s tall, upright form. Their principal weapon was the two-edged
battle-axe, which served for throwing as well as striking.
They also carried frightful javelins with barbed points. Their
own laws describe them as brave warriors, profound in their
plans, manly and healthy in body, handsome, bold, impetuous,
and hardy. But their enemies, perhaps with some justice, denounced
them as the most faithless and cruel of men. The
distinguishing ornament of the kings was their hair, which was
left uncut, flowing freely over the shoulder. The people were
still heathen, untamed and uncivilized, yet in constant intercourse
with the Romans in Gaul.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<h4>CLOVIS, THE FIRST FRANKISH KING.</h4>

<p>The name of Clovis is not alone to be remembered as that of
the founder of the kingdom of the Franks, but for the remarkable
so-called conversion which he experienced during a hard-fought
battle with the Alemanni. While the result was yet in
doubt, Clovis, in the face of his army, called upon the new God,
Christ, and vowed to serve him, if he would help him now.
He was victorious; received instruction from St. Remigius, and
was then baptized, with three thousand of his noblest Franks,
in the cathedral at Rheims. “Bow thy head in silence, Sigambrian,”
said the saint; “worship what thou hast hitherto
destroyed; war against what thou hast worshiped.” This was
by no means the only instance of wholesale conversions to
Christianity in consequence of a victory. The heathen, when
defeated by Christians, commonly ascribed the result to the
superior strength of the Christian God, and often resolved to
seek his protection for themselves. It was the Catholic, not
the Arian faith, which Clovis adopted. He was straightway
recognized by the Pope as “the most Christian king,” the appointed
protector and propagator of the true faith against Arian
Germany.</p>

<p>Clovis built up his kingdom with many a deed of blood, but
with great vigor. His empire comprised German as well as
Roman territory; but struck root firmly in the old native soil,
from which it drew ever new strength: and therefore it was
that its duration was not merely momentary, like that of the
Gothic kingdoms, but it proved the beginning of the monarchy
of the Middle Ages, the beginning of a new national life, in
which Roman form was animated with fresh German strength.
Clovis ruled his wide realm from Paris, a city which had existed
even before the days of Cæsar and the Romans in Gaul.
He died in Paris at the early age of forty-five.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From Clovis to <i>Karl der Grosse</i> (French, <i>Charlemagne</i>;
Latin, <i>Carolus Magnus</i>), a period of two hundred and fifty
years, we witness not only the vicissitudes incident to the establishment
of a new social and political order upon the ruins
of the old, with all the ferocity of manner and barbarity of action
to be expected in such an age; but also there is the gradual
displacement of the old pagan religions by the newer one
called Christianity. It is a period of strifes, of jealousies, and
blood. It was toward the last of this period that occurred the
memorable battle of Poitiers, between the Franks under Karl,
afterward surnamed <i>Martel</i>, and the Saracens, who having
crossed from Africa and possessed themselves of entire Spain,
next collected a large army, and under command of Abderrahman,
Viceroy of the Caliph of Damascus, set out for the
conquest of France and Germany, as yet an undivided nationality.
Thus the new Christian faith of Europe, still engaged
in quelling the last strength of the ancient paganism, was suddenly
called upon to meet the newer faith of Mohammed, which
had determined to subdue the world.</p>

<p>Not only France, but the Eastern Empire, Italy and England
looked to Karl, in this emergency. The Saracens crossed the
Pyrenees with 350,000 warriors, accompanied by their wives
and children, as if they were sure of victory and meant to possess
the land. Karl called the military strength of the whole
broad kingdom into the field, collected an army nearly equal
in numbers, and finally, in October, 732, the two hosts stood
face to face, near the city of Poitiers. It was a struggle almost
as grand, and as fraught with important consequences to the
world, as that of Aëtius and Attila, nearly 300 years before.
Six days were spent in preparations, and on the seventh the
battle began. The Saracens attacked with that daring and impetuosity
which had gained them so many victories; but, as the
old chronicle says, “the Franks, with their strong hearts and
powerful bodies, stood like a wall, and hewed down the Arabs
with iron hands.” When night fell, 200,000 dead and wounded
lay upon the field. Karl made preparations for resuming the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
battle on the following morning, but he found no enemy. The
Saracens had retired during the night, leaving their camps and
stores behind them, and their leader, Abderrahman, among the
slain. This was the first great check the cause of Islam received,
after a series of victories more wonderful than those of
Rome. From that day the people bestowed upon Karl the
surname of <i>Martel</i>, the Hammer, and as Charles Martel he is
best known in history.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<h4>CHARACTER OF THE GERMAN CHRISTIANITY AT THIS TIME.</h4>

<p>The Christianity of the Germans, and even that of the Roman
provinces, for many generations after the date of their “conversion,”
was a very different kind of religion from that which
is now held by enlightened Christians. Constantine and several
of his successors were actually worshiped after death by
multitudes of the Christians of those days. The apostolic doctrines
were not conceived as a system of belief by the people,
nor even by their teachers; the personal sovereignty of Christ
as a king and warrior, and the future heaven or hell to be
awarded by him, were apprehended as practical truths, but
were overlaid with a dense mass of superstitious notions and
observances, many of them legacies from heathenism. Above
all, the Germans indulged without stint their passion for the
wonderful; and the power of Christianity over them depended
largely on the supply of miracles and of potent relics which it
could furnish them. The workers of miraculous cures were
numerous; they were esteemed as the favorites of heaven, and
cities and princes contended with one another for their bones.
Some of the popes were wise enough to discourage the zeal for
miracles; and as late as A. D. 590, Pope Gregory I. wrote to St.
Augustine, of England, cautioning him against spiritual pride
as a worker of them. But it was not long before the papacy
became the great center from which relics of the saints were
distributed throughout the Church. The Roman catacombs
were ransacked, and bones of saints found in an abundance
sufficient to supply Christendom for ages. The Pope’s guaranty
of genuineness was final; and this resource contributed immeasurably
to increase the wealth and power of the Holy See.
The legends of the saints, as circulated and preserved, mainly
by tradition, were for centuries the intellectual food of the
Church at large; and were filled with idle and monotonous
tales of wonderful cures in mind and body, wrought by the holy
men and women in their lives, or by their corpses or their
tombs. No doubt was entertained, even by the most intelligent,
of the truth of these miracles. The modern conception
of nature, as the work of a divine will which is unchangeable,
and which therefore expresses itself in fixed, uniform laws, was
then unknown. The spiritual conception of Christianity, as
life by a personal trust in a pure, holy, and loving God, was set
forth, indeed, by a few writers and preachers, and was doubtless
verified in the experience of many a humble heart; but it
was far above the thoughts of the people, or even of the clergy
at large. To them no religion was of any value which was not
magical in its methods and powers, and a charm to secure good
fortune or to avert danger. In short, the Church was one
thing, Christianity another; and the priestly ambition of the
great organization to rule over men’s lives and estates entirely
eclipsed and obscured the spiritual work of the kingdom which
is not of this world. Nothing in the early German character is
more attractive than the habitual and general chastity of the
people, and their reverence for the marriage tie. But the great
migrations corrupted them; and the degradation of marriage
in the succeeding centuries was promoted and completed by
the influence of the Church. Hardly any agency can be traced
in history which has wrought greater social and moral evil than
the contempt for human love and for the marriage tie, which
was sedulously cultivated by the Roman Church from the beginning
of the fourth century. Yet, there are indications
enough to satisfy us that the doctrines of the New Testament
had not lost their power; and that truth, purity, divine charity,
and Christian heroism were yet kept alive in many hearts.
Thousands of men and women, whose minds and lives were
darkened by the teachings and practices of asceticism, monasticism
and gross superstitions, still cherished a devout, self-sacrificing
love for their unseen Master and Lord and stood ready
to die for him. Even the idea of Christian brotherhood was
not entirely lost; and the common worship of the same Redeemer
by master and slave did much to mitigate the horrors
that grew out of their relation.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<h4>CHARLES THE GREAT.</h4>

<p>The history of Germany may now for half a century be ranged
about the central figure, Charles the Great, more commonly
called Charlemagne. Indeed, so conspicuous a figure is he
that it is impossible for all subsequent history to lose sight of
him. The decayed Merovingian scepter when it fell into his
hands was swayed with such unprecedented vigor and ability
that its old name soon disappeared, and henceforth it is the
Carlovingian, and Charles becomes the head and founder of a
new dynasty. The first years of his rule are marked by continuous
wars of conquest. The brave and savage Saxons resisted
him and the Christianity which he championed until compelled
by his all-conquering arms to yield. Saxony emerged
from his hands subdued and Christian, divided into eight bishopries,
studded with new cities and abbeys which proved centers
of civilization; and that wild country, until then barbarous and
pagan, entered into communion with the rest of the empire.</p>

<p>He next turned his attention to Italy, where his career of victory
was uninterrupted. He visited Rome, and, dismounting at
a thousand paces from the walls, walked in procession to the
church of St. Peter on the Vatican Hill, kissing the steps as he
ascended in honor of the saints by whom they had been trodden.
In the vestibule of the church he was received by the
Pope, who embraced him with great affection, the choir chanting
the psalm, “Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the
Lord.” Then they descended into the vaults, and offered up
their prayers together at the shrine of St. Peter.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<h4>EXTENT OF HIS EMPIRE—HIS CORONATION.</h4>

<p>In the course of a reign of forty-five years, Charlemagne extended
the limits of his empire beyond the Danube; subdued
Dacia, Dalmatia, and Istria, conquered and subjected all the
barbarous tribes to the banks of the Vistula, and successfully
encountered the arms of the Saracens, the Huns, the Bulgarians,
and the Saxons. His war with the Saxons was of more
than thirty years duration, and their final conquest was not
achieved without an inhuman waste of blood, through what has
been considered a mistaken zeal for the propagation of Christianity,
by measures which that religion can not be said to sanction
or approve. All these wars were very nearly finished in
the year 800. Charlemagne then found himself master of
France, of Germany, of three-quarters of Italy, and a part of
Spain. He had increased by more than a third the extent of
territory which his father had left him. These vast possessions
were no longer a kingdom, but an empire. He thought he had
done enough to be authorized to seat himself on the throne of
the West; and, as his father had required at the hands of the
Pope his regal crown, so it was from the Pope that he demanded
his imperial diadem. He was, therefore, with great ceremony,
created Emperor of the West in St. Peter’s, at Rome, by
Pope Leo III., on Christmas day 800. It was a great event, for
that imperial title which had remained buried under the ruins
wrought by the barbarians, was drawn thence by the Roman
pontiff, and shown to scattered nations and enemies as a
rallying sign.</p>

<p>The crown which he received was destined to be for one
thousand and six years the symbol of German unity, whilst
the assembled people shouted, “Long life and victory to Carolus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Augustus, the great and peace-bringing Roman Emperor,
whom God hath crowned!” Thus, 324 years after the imperial
dignity had disappeared, it was renewed by Charles. In this
coronation act Pope Leo III. had fulfilled a function like St.
Remy did in consecrating Clovis. His successors constituted
it a privilege, and the pontiffs considered themselves the dispensers
of crowns. During the whole of the middle ages the
imperial consecration could only be given at Rome, and from
the hands of the Holy Father. More than one war arose out
of this prerogative.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<h4>THE CHARACTER AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF CHARLEMAGNE—HIS
PLACE IN HISTORY.</h4>

<p>Charlemagne, or Charles the Great, is the name which history
has agreed to give to the founder of the German empire—incorporating
the epithet with the name itself. We have recited in
outline the facts of his wonderful career, as they are recorded
in the meagre records of contemporary historians, and must rely
upon the same authentic testimony in attempting to estimate his
mind, character, and work. But the Charles of history is one;
the Charles of heroic legend and popular fame is another. The
former is a powerful conqueror and politic statesman, whom
some eminent writers regard as the greatest of all monarchs;
the latter is a Christian saint, superhuman in strength, beauty,
and wisdom, incapable of defeat in war, of error in judgment,
or of infirmity or corruption in his own will. Thus the song of
Roland says: “His eyes shone like the morning star; his
glance was dazzling as the noonday sun. Terrible to his foes,
kind to the poor, victorious in war, merciful to offenders, devoted
to God, he was an upright judge, who knew all the laws,
and taught them to his people as he learned them from the
angels. In short, he bore the sword as God’s own servant.”
As Theodoric had been the center of the ancient popular minstrelsy,
so Charles the Great became the central figure in that
more cultivated heroic poetry, chiefly the work of the clergy,
in which were celebrated the deeds of the twelve paladins, with
Roland and the fight of Roncesvalles:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“When Charlemain with all his peerage fell</div>
<div class="verse i1">By Fontarabia.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When we consider the profound impression made on the popular
mind by this person, as represented in legend and song,
we are almost ready to inquire whether its influence upon later
German history was not greater than that of his authentic
achievements. But it is true that the entire German race owes
to him its first political organization. It was the purpose of his
life, which never wavered, to unite all the German tribes under
the control of one imperial government and of one Christian
Church. In the greater part of this work he succeeded, and
thus left the stamp of his mind upon the following centuries,
through all the Middle Ages. The national consciousness of
the collective German tribes dates from his reign, and it is at
the beginning of the ninth century that “the Germans” are first
spoken of in contrast with the Roman peoples of the empire,
although the national name did not come into general use until
four generations later, in the reign of Otto the Great. When
Charles mounted the throne, he was twenty-four years of age,
in the strength and prime of his youth. His person was huge
and strong, combining the presence and muscular power of the
heroes of song; so that he found it sport to fight with the gigantic
wild bulls in the forest of Ardennes. His passion for labor,
war, and danger was that of the adventurous warriors of the
great migration. In the momentous affairs of state, he exhibited
the want of feeling and the unscrupulousness which
have been common to nearly all great warriors; but in daily intercourse
with those around him, he had the mildness, cheerfulness,
and freshness of spirit which add so much grace to
true greatness. These characteristics were those of his people;
but that which specially distinguished him was the far-seeing
mind, which had caught from ancient Rome the conception
of a universal state, and was wise enough, without slavish copying,
to adapt this conception to the peculiar requirements of
the widely different race he ruled. This lofty intellect appears
the more wonderful, that no one can tell how he obtained his
mental growth, or who were his instructors; he seems to shine
out of the darkness of his age like a sun.</p>

<p>Charlemagne’s active mind gave attention to all matters,
great and small. His untiring diligence, and his surprising
swiftness in apprehension and decision, enabled him to dispatch
an amount of business perhaps never undertaken by another
monarch, unless by Frederick II., of Prussia, or by Napoleon
Bonaparte. He was simple in his own attire, usually
wearing a linen coat, woven at home by the women of his own
family, and over it the large, warm Frisian mantle; and he demanded
simplicity in his followers, and scoffed at his courtiers
when their gorgeous silks and tinsel, brought from the East,
were torn to rags in the rough work of the chase. Hunting in
his favorite forest of Ardennes was the chief delight and recreation
of his court. Next to this, he enjoyed swimming in the
warm baths at Aix, which became his favorite residence. At
his meals he listened to reading; and even condescended to
join the monks, detailed for the purpose, in reading exercises.
He founded schools in all the convents, and visited them in
person, encouraging the diligent pupils, and reproving the negligent.
He also introduced Roman teachers of music, to improve
the church-singing of the Franks; while he required that sermons
should be preached in the language of the people. Thus
he diligently promoted popular education, while he strove to
make up by study what he had lost by the neglect of his own
culture in youth. He gathered men of learning—poets, historians,
and copyists—around him, the most prominent of them
being Anglo-Saxons, of whom the wise and pious Alcuin was
chief. Even when an old man, he found time, though often
only at night, to practice in writing his hand so accustomed to
the sword; and having long been familiar with the Latin language,
which he tried to diffuse among the people, undertook
to learn the Greek also. He highly esteemed his native language,
too. He gave German names to the months and the
winds; caused a German grammar to be compiled; and took
pains to collect the ancient heroic songs of the German minstrels,
though his son, in his monkish zeal, destroyed them. He
reverenced the clergy highly: granted them tithes throughout
the empire, and everywhere watched over the increasing endowments
and estates of the Church, in whose possessions at
that time both agriculture and morality were better cared for
than elsewhere. Most of the bishops and abbots were selected
by the king himself.</p>

<p>Charlemagne’s personal character must not be judged by the
standards of a time so remote from him as ours. He has been
called dissolute; and it is true that he utterly disregarded the
marriage tie, when it would limit either his pleasures or his ambition.
He married five wives, only to dishonor them. He
even encouraged, as it seems, his own daughters to live loose
lives at home; refusing to give them in marriage to princes, lest
their husbands might become competitors for a share of the
kingdom. But he was never controlled by his favorite women,
nor did he neglect state business for indulgence. Charlemagne
has been censured as cruel; and, indeed, there are few acts
recorded in history of more wanton cruelty than his slaughter
in cold blood of thousands of Saxons at Verden. Yet this was
not done in the exercise of passion or hatred, but as a measure
of policy, a means deliberately devised to secure a definite end,
in which it was successful. Charlemagne was never cruel upon
impulse; but his inclinations were to gentleness and kindness.
The key to his character is his unbounded ambition. In the
pursuit of power he knew no scruple; the most direct and
efficient means were always the right means to him. There is
no doubt of his earnest attachment to the Christian Church and
to the orthodox doctrines, as he understood them. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
was not associated with an appreciation of Christian morality,
or a sense of human brotherhood. His passion for conquest
was in large part a fanatical zeal for the propagation of a religion
which he regarded as inseparable from his empire.</p>

<p>Charlemagne was held in high honor by foreign nations.
The Caliph of Bagdad, Haroun-al-Raschid, wielded in the East
a power comparable with his own. To Charlemagne he sent a
friendly embassy, with precious gifts, and it was reciprocated
in the same spirit. The kings of the Normans expressed their
respect for him in a similar way. But his own taste esteemed
the ring of a good sword more than gold. His person and his
private life have been vividly depicted to us by Einhard
(Eginhard), a youth educated at his court, to whom, according
to legend, the emperor gave one of his daughters for a wife.
Charlemagne was tall and strongly formed, measuring from
crown to sole seven times the length of his own foot. He had
an open brow, very large, quick eyes, an abundance of fine
hair, which was white in his last years, and a cheerful countenance.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<h4>RESULTS OF HIS WARS AND RULE.</h4>

<p>Some writers have sought to represent Charlemagne as a
royal sage, a pacific prince, who only took up arms in self-defense.
Truth compels a more faithful though less flattering
portraiture. He had no invasion to dread. The Saracens were
scattered, the Avars (Bavarians) weakened, and the Saxons
impotent to carry on any serious war beyond their forests and
marshes. If he led the Franks beyond their own frontiers, it
was that he had, like so many other monarchs, the ambition of
reigning over more nations, and of leaving a high-sounding
name to posterity. All that he attempted beyond the Pyrenees
proved abortive. It would have been of greater value had he
subdued the Bretons, so far as to have made them sooner enter
French nationality, instead of contenting himself with a precarious
submission. The conquest of the Lombard kingdom
profited neither France nor Italy, but only the Pope, whose
political position it raised, and whose independence it secured
for the future. The country for which those long wars had the
happiest result, was that one which had suffered most from
them, Germany. Before Charlemagne, Almayne was still
Germany—that is to say, a shapeless chaos of pagan or Christian
tribes, but all barbarian, enemies of one another, united
by no single tie. There were Franks, Saxons, Thuringians,
and Bavarians. After him there was a German people, and
there will be a kingdom of Germany. It was great glory for
him to have created a people—a glory which few conquerors
have acquired; for they destroy much more than they found.
His reign lasted forty-four years, and may be summed up as an
immense and glorious effort to bring under subjection the barbarian
world and all that which survived the Roman civilization;
to put an end to the chaos born of invasion, and to found
a settled state of society in which the authority of the emperor,
closely united to that of the Pope, should maintain order alike
in Church and State—a very difficult problem, which it was
given Charlemagne to solve, but of which all the difficulties
did not become apparent until after his death. The work of
Charlemagne, in fact, did not last. The name of this powerful
though rude genius is not the less surrounded with a lasting
glory; and it has remained in the memory of nations with
that of three or four other great men who have done, if not
always the greatest amount of good, at least have made the
most noise in the world. As to Charlemagne, the amount of
good accomplished very far surpasses that which was only vain
renown and sterile ambition. He created modern Germany;
and if that chain of nations, the links of which he had sought
to rivet, broke, his great image loomed over the feudal times as
the genius of order, continually inviting the dispersed races to
emerge from chaos, and seek union and peace under the sway
of a strong and renowned chief.</p>

<p>Charlemagne died, January 28, 814, in his seventy-second
year, and was buried at Aix-la-Chapelle, in a church which he
had built there after his Italian conquests, in the Lombard
style. Eginhard, his secretary and friend, who wrote his life,
tells us that he was considerably above six feet in height, and
well proportioned in all respects, excepting that his neck was
somewhat too short and thick. His imperial crown, which is
still preserved at Vienna, would fit only the head of a giant.
His air was dignified, but at the same time his manners were
social. Charlemagne had no fewer than five wives; of his four
sons, only one survived him, Louis, the youngest and most incapable,
who succeeded him on the imperial throne.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<h3 id="VOGELWEIDE">WALTHER VON DER VOGELWEIDE.</h3>

<p>As an introduction to a brief extract upon Walther von der
Vogelweide, we give Longfellow’s beautiful little poem:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Walther’s lyrical poems are distinguished from those of most
of his contemporaries by a strong impress of sincerity and a
wide range of thought.</p>

<p>When he hails the coming of the spring after a long winter,
he imitates in the gladness of his heart the carols of the birds,
and goes on in melodious verses to speak of the beauty of the
lady to whom he dedicates his song, but whom he never names.
In the next song the reader, to his surprise, will find the minstrel
changed into a satirist, who denounces the political and
religious corruptions of his time, rebukes the Pope for his
worldly ambition and predicts a speedy ruin of the world.
These are not all the notes of the scale on which his songs are
constructed. As a specimen of his lighter and more popular
style, the following strophe in praise of German women may
serve:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In many foreign lands I’ve been</div>
<div class="verse">And knights and ladies there have seen;</div>
<div class="verse">But here alone I find my rest—</div>
<div class="verse">Old Germany is still the best;</div>
<div class="verse">Some other lands have pleased me well;</div>
<div class="verse">But here—’tis here I choose to dwell.</div>
<div class="verse">German men have virtues rare,</div>
<div class="verse">And German maids are angels fair.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He rises to a higher strain than this in other lyrics, where he
places domestic virtue above external beauty, and speaks of
<i>minne</i> in the higher interpretation of the word. “Even where
it can not be returned,” he says, “if devoted to one worthy of it,
it ennobles a man’s life. His affection for one teaches him to
be kind and generous to all.” Walther pleasantly describes
himself as by no means good-looking, and censures all praise
bestowed on men for their merely exterior advantages. And
he is no fanatical worshiper of feminine beauty, affirming that
it may sometimes be a thin mask worn over bad passions.</p>

<p>With regard to their moral and social purport the verses of
Walther have a considerable historical interest. They show us
how insecurely the Church held the faith and loyalty of German
men in the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Walther is bold and violent in his defiance and contempt of
the Pope’s usurpation of temporal authority. Referring in one
place to a fable commonly believed in his times, he says:
“When Constantine gave the spear of temporal power, as well
as the spear and the crown to the See of Rome, the angels in
heaven lamented, and well they might; for that power is now
abused to annoy the emperor and to stir up the princes, his vassals
against him.” The poet was as earnest in dissuading the
people from contributing money to support the Crusades.
“Very little of it,” he says, “will ever find its way into the Holy
Land. The Pope is now filling his Italian coffers with our
German silver.” This saying seems to have been very popular
for a tame moralist who lived in Walther’s time complains that,
by making such statements, the poet was perverting the faith
of many people. “All his fine verses,” the moralist adds, “will
not atone for that bad libel on Rome.” Yet the author of it was
quite orthodox in doctrine, and was enthusiastic in his zeal for
rescuing the Holy Sepulcher from the Saracens.</p>

<p>Many of his verses express earnestly his love for his native
land, and his grief for social and political disorders of his
times. He believes that the world is falling a prey to anarchy.
“I hear the rushing of the water,” he says, “and I watch the
movements of the fish that swim in its depth. I explore the
habits of the creatures of this world in the forest and in the
field, from the beast of the field down to the insect, and I find
that there is nowhere any life that is not vexed by anarchy and
strife. Warfare is found everywhere, and yet some order is
preserved even among animals; but in my own native land,
where the petty princes are lifting themselves up against the
emperor, we are hastening on to anarchy.” The course of
events proved that he was too true in this prediction. Resignation
and despair, rather than any hope of a reconciliation of
religion with practical life, characterize other meditative poems.
The following is one of the best of this class:</p>

<div class="verse">I sat one day upon a stone,</div>
<div class="verse">And meditated long, alone,</div>

<div class="verse">In silence to myself I said:</div>
<div class="verse">“How, in these days of care and strife,</div>
<div class="verse">Shall I employ my fleeting life?</div>

<p>The legends of Hans Sachs are all pointed with satire. Readers
now-a-days find in them a coarseness which jars their ideas
of reverence and refinement, but which in the sixteenth century
was in perfect keeping with the popular taste. One of the best
of his legends is that of “St. Peter and the Goat.” “We are
told that once upon a time St. Peter was perplexed by an apparent
prevalence of injustice in the world; and ventured to think
that he could arrange matters better if he held the reins of
government. He frankly confesses these thoughts to his Master.
Meanwhile a peasant girl comes to him and complains
that she has to do a hard day’s work, and at the same time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
keep in order a frolicsome young goat. ‘Now,’ says the Lord
to Peter, ‘you must have pity on this girl, and must take charge
of the goat. That will serve as an introduction to your managing
the affairs of the universe.’”</p>

<p>The legend goes on:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The young goat had a playful mind</div>
<div class="verse i1">And never liked to be confined;</div>

<div class="verse i1">Followed the goat, in a desperate chase;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Over the hills and among the briers</div>
<div class="verse i1">The goat runs on and never tires,</div>
<div class="verse i1">While Peter, behind, on the grassy plain,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Runs on, panting and sighing in vain.</div>
<div class="verse i1">All day, beneath a scorching sun,</div>
<div class="verse i1">The good Apostle had to run</div>
<div class="verse i1">Till evening came; the goat was caught</div>
<div class="verse i1">And safely to the Master brought,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Then, with a smile, to Peter said</div>
<div class="verse i1">The Lord: ‘Well, friend, how have you sped?</div>
<div class="verse i1">If such a task your powers has tried</div>
<div class="verse i1">How could you keep the world so wide?’</div>
<div class="verse i1">Then Peter, with his toil distressed,</div>
<div class="verse i1">His folly, with a sigh, confessed;</div>

<h3 id="LUTHER">MARTIN LUTHER.</h3>

<h4>The Book of Psalms.</h4>

<p>The heart of man is like a ship out on a wild sea, and driven
by storm-winds blowing from all the four quarters of
the world; now impelled by fear and care for coming evil,
now disturbed by vexation and grief for present misfortune,
now urged along by hope and a confidence of future good,
now wafted by joy and contentment. These storm-winds
of the soul teach us how to speak in good earnest, to open our
hearts and to utter their contents. The man actually in want
and fear does not express himself quietly, like a man who only
talks about fear and want; a heart filled with joy utters itself
and sings in a way not to be imitated by one who is all the
time in fear; “It does not come from the heart,” men say,
when a sorrowful man tries to laugh, or a merry man would
weep.… Now of what does this book of Psalms
mostly consist but of earnest expressions of the heart’s emotions—the
storm-winds, as I have called them? Where are
finer expressions of joy than the Psalms of praise and thanksgiving?
There you look into the hearts of the saints, as if you
looked into a fair and delightful garden, aye, or into heaven
itself—and you see how lovely and pleasant flowers are springing
up there out of manifold happy and beautiful thoughts of
God and all His mercies.… But again, where will you
find deeper, more mournful and pitiful words of sorrow than in
the Psalms devoted to lamentation? I conclude then that the
Psalter is a hand-book for religious men, wherein every one,
whatever may be his condition, may find words that will rhyme
with it; and Psalms as exactly fitted to suit his wants as if they
had been written solely for his benefit.—<i>From the Preface to
Luther’s Book of Psalms.</i></p>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In the oldest times, and in an eastern land,</div>
<div class="verse">There lived a man who had a precious ring.</div>
<div class="verse">This gem—an opal of a hundred tints—</div>

<div class="verse">Preserved it well, and, by his will, declared</div>
<div class="verse">It should forever in his house remain?</div>
<div class="verse">At last when death came near, he called the son</div>
<div class="verse">Whom he loved best, and gave to him the ring,</div>
<div class="verse">With one strict charge:—“My son, when you must die,</div>
<div class="verse">Let this be given to your own darling child—</div>
<div class="verse">The son whom you love best, without regard</div>

<div class="verse">At last, when death drew nigh, the father felt</div>

<h3>III.—RIVERS AND GLACIERS.</h3>

<p>We have found that the water of the river is largely derived
from springs, and that all spring-water contains more or less
mineral materials dissolved out of the brooks. Every river,
therefore, is carrying not merely water, but large quantities of
mineral matters into the sea. It has been calculated, for instance,
that the Rhine in one year carries into the North Sea
lime enough to make three hundred and thirty-two thousand
millions of oyster shells. This chemically-dissolved material
is not visible to the eye, and in no way affects the color of the
water. At all times of the year, as long as the water flows, this
invisible transport of some of the materials of rocks must be
going on.</p>

<p>But let us now again watch the same river in flood. The
water is no longer clear, but dull and dirty. You ascertained
that this discoloration arises from mud and sand suspended in
the water. You see that over and above the mineral matter in
chemical solution, the river is hurrying seaward with vast quantities
of other and visible materials. And thus it is clear that
at least one great part of the work of rivers must be to transport
the mouldered parts of the land which are carried into them by
springs or by rain.</p>

<p>But the rivers, too, help in the general destruction of the surface
of the land. Of this you may readily be assured, by looking
at the sides or bed of a stream when the water is low.
Where the stream flows over hard rock, you find the rock all
smoothed and ground away; and the stones lying in the water-course
are all more or less rounded and smoothed. When
these stones were originally broken by frosts or otherwise, from
crags and cliffs, they were sharp-edged, as you can prove by
looking at the heaps of blocks lying at the foot of any precipice,
or steep bank of rock. But when they fell, or were washed into
the river, they began to get rolled and rubbed, until their sharp
edges were ground away, and they came to wear the smooth
rounded forms which we see in the ordinary gravel.</p>

<p>While the stones are ground down, they, at the same time,
grind down the rocks which form the sides and bottom of the
river-channel over which they are driven. You can even see
in some of the eddies of the stream how the stones are kept
moving round until they actually excavate deep round cavities,
called pot-holes, in the solid rock.</p>

<p>Now, it is clear that two results must follow from this ceaseless
wear and tear of rocks and stones in the channel of a
stream. In the first place, a great deal of mud and sand must
be produced; and, in the second place, the bed of the river
must be ground down so as to become deeper and wider. The
sand and mud are added to the other similar material washed
into the streams by rain from the mouldering surface of the
land. By the deepening and widening of the water-courses,
such picturesque features as gorges and ravines are excavated
out of the solid rock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Look, again, at the channel of a river in summer. You see
it covered with sheets of gravel in one place, beds of sand in
another, while here and there a piece of hard rock sticks up
through these different kinds of river-stuff. Note some portion
of the loose materials, and you find it to be continually shifting.
A patch of gravel or sand may remain for a time, but the little
stones and grains of which it is made up are always changing
as the water covers and moves them. In fact, the loose materials
over which the river flows are somewhat like the river itself.
You come back to its banks after many years, and you
find the river there still, with the same ripples, and eddies, and
gentle murmuring sound. But though the river has been there
constantly all the time, its water has been changing every
minute, as you can watch it changing still. So, although the
channel is always more or less covered with loose materials,
these are not always the same. They are perpetually being
pushed onward, and others, from higher up the stream, come
behind to take their place.</p>

<p>It is not in the bottoms of the rivers, then, that the material
worn away from the surface of the land can find any lasting
rest. And yet the rivers do get rid of a good deal of this material
as they roll along. You have, perhaps, noticed that a
river is often bordered with a strip of flat plain, the surface of
which is only a few feet above the level of the water. Most of
our rivers have such margins, and, indeed, seem each to wind
to and fro through a long, level, meadow-like plain. Now this
plain is really made up from the finer particles of decomposed
rocks which the river has carried along. During floods, the
river, swollen and muddy, rises above its banks, and spreads
over the low ground on either side. Whenever this takes place,
the overflowing water moves more slowly over the flats; and,
as its current is thus checked, it can not hold so much mud and
sand, but allows some of these materials to settle down to the
bottom. In this way the overflowed tracts get a coating of soil
laid over them by the river, and when the waters retire this
coating adds a little to the height of the plain. The same thing
takes place year after year, until by degrees the plain gets so far
raised that the river, which all this while is also busy deepening
its channel, can not overflow it even at the highest floods. In
course of time the river, as it winds from side to side, cuts away
slices of the plain and forms a newer one at a lower level. And
thus a series of terraces is gradually made, rising step by step
above the river.</p>

<p>Still the laying down of its sand and mud by a river to form
one or more such river-terraces is, after all, only a temporary
disposal of these materials. They are still liable to be carried
away, and in truth they are carried off continually as the river
eats away its banks.</p>

<p>When the current of a river is checked as it enters the sea or
a lake, the feebler flow of the water allows the sand and mud
to sink to the bottom. By degrees some portions of the bottom
come in this way to be filled up to the surface of the river, and
wide flat marshy spaces are formed on either side of the main
stream. During floods these spaces are overflowed with muddy
water, in the same way as in the case of the valley plains just
described, and a coating of mud or sand is laid down on them
until they slowly rise above the ordinary level of the river,
which winds about among them in endless branching streams.
Vegetation springs up on these flat swampy lands; animals,
too, find food and shelter there; and thus a new territory is
made by the work of the river.</p>

<p>These flat river-formed tracts are called deltas, because the
one which was best known to the ancients, that of the Nile, had
the shape of the Greek letter Δ (<i>delta</i>). This is the general
form which is taken by accumulations at the mouths of rivers;
the flat delta gets narrow toward the inland, and broader toward
the sea. Some of them are of enormous size; the delta of the
Mississippi, for example.</p>

<p>Each delta, then, is made of materials worn from the surface
of the land, and brought down by the river. And yet vast
though some of these deltas are, they do not show all the materials
which have been so worn away. A great deal is carried
far out and deposited on the sea-bottom; for the sea is the
great basin into which the spoils of the land are continually
borne.</p>

<p>Having now followed the course taken by the water which
falls on the land as rain, we come to that taken by snow.</p>

<p>On the tops of some of the highest mountains in Britain snow
lies for great part of the year. On some of them, indeed, there
are shady clefts wherein you may meet with deep snow-wreaths
even in the heat of summer.</p>

<p>But in other parts of Europe, where the mountains are more
lofty, the peaks and higher shoulders of the hills gleam white
all the year with unmelted snow.</p>

<p>Let us see why it is that perpetual snow should occur in such
regions, and what part this snow plays in the general machinery
of the world.</p>

<p>You have learned that the higher parts of the atmosphere are
extremely cold. You know also that in the far north and the
far south, around those two opposite parts of the earth’s surface
called the Poles, the climate is extremely cold—so cold as to
give rise to dreary expanses of ice and snow, where sea and
land are frozen, and where the heat of summer is not enough
to thaw all the ice and drive away all the snow. Between these
two polar tracts of cold, wherever mountains are lofty enough
to get into the high parts of the atmosphere where the temperature
is usually below the freezing-point, the vapor condensed
from the air falls upon them, not as rain, but as snow. Their
heads and upper heights are thus covered with perpetual snow.
In such high mountainous regions the heat of the summer always
melts the snow from the lower hills, though it leaves the
higher parts still covered. From year to year it is noticed that
there is a line or limit below which the ground gets freed of its
snow, and above which the snow remains. This limit is called
the snow-line, or the limit of perpetual snow. Its height varies
in different parts of the world. It is highest in the warmer regions
on either side of the equator, where it reaches to 15,000
feet above the sea. In the cold polar tracts, on the other hand,
it approaches the sea-level. In other words, while in the polar
tracts the climate is so cold that perpetual snow is found even
close to the sea-level, the equatorial regions are so warm that
you must climb many thousand feet before you can reach the
cold layers of the air where snow can remain all the year.</p>

<p>There is, you see, one striking difference between rain and
snow. If rain had been falling for the same length of time, the
roads and fields would still have been visible, for each drop of
rain, instead of remaining where it fell, would either have sunk
into the soil, or have flowed off into the nearest brook. But
each snowflake, on the contrary, lies where it falls, unless it
happens to be caught up and driven on by the wind to some
other spot where it can finally rest. Rain disappears from the
ground as soon as it can; snow stays still as long as it can.</p>

<p>You will see at once that this marked difference of behavior
must give rise to some equally strong differences in the further
procedure of these two kinds of moisture. You have followed
the progress of the rain; now let us try to find out what becomes
of the snow.</p>

<p>In such a country as ours, where there is no perpetual snow,
you can without much difficulty answer this question. Each
fall of snow in winter-time remains on the ground as long as
the air is not warm enough to melt it. Evaporation, indeed,
goes on from the surface of snow and ice, as well as from water:
so that a layer of snow would in the end disappear, by being
absorbed into the air as vapor, even though none of it had
previously been melted into running water. But it is by what
we call a thaw that our snow is chiefly dissipated; that is, a
rise in the temperature, and a consequent melting of the snow.
When the snow melts, it sinks into the soil and flows off into
brooks in the same way as rain.</p>

<p>In the regions of perpetual snow the heat of summer can not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
melt all the snow which falls there in the year. What other
way of escape, then, can the frozen moisture find?</p>

<p>You will remember that the surplus rainfall flows off by
means of rivers. Now the surplus snow-fall above the snow-line
has a similar kind of drainage. It flows off by means of
what are called glaciers.</p>

<p>When a considerable depth of snow has accumulated, the
pressure upon the lower layers from what lies above them
squeezes them into a firm mass. The surface of the ground is
usually sloped in some direction, seldom quite flat. And
among the high mountains the slopes are often, as you know,
very steep. When snow gathers deeply on sloping ground,
there comes a time when the force of gravity overcomes the
tendency of the pressed snow to remain where it is, and then
the snow begins to slide slowly down the slope. From one
slope it passes on downward to the next, joined continually by
other sliding masses from neighboring slopes until they all unite
into one long tongue which creeps slowly down some valley to
a point where it melts. This tongue from the snow-fields is the
glacier. It really drains these snow-fields of their excess of
snow as much as a river drains a district of its excess of water.</p>

<p>But the glacier which comes out of the snow-fields is itself
made not of snow, but of ice. The snow, as it slides downward,
is pressed together into ice. You have learned that each
snowflake is made of little crystals of ice. A mass of snow is
thus only a mass of minute crystals of ice with air between.
Hence when the snow gets pressed together, the air is squeezed
out, and the separated crystals of ice freeze together into a solid
mass. You know that you can make a snowball very hard by
squeezing it firmly between the hands. The more tightly you
press it the harder it gets. You are doing to it just what happens
when a glacier is formed out of the eternal snows. You
are pressing out the air, and allowing the little particles of ice
to freeze to each other and form a compact piece of ice. But
you can not squeeze nearly all the air out, consequently the ball,
even after all your efforts, is still white from the imprisoned air.
Among the snowfields, however, the pressure is immensely
greater than yours; the air is more and more pressed out, and
at last the snow becomes clear transparent ice.</p>

<p>A glacier, then, is a river, not of water, but of ice, coming
down from the snow-fields. It descends sometimes a long way
below the snow-line, creeping down very slowly along the valley
which it covers from side to side. Its surface all the time is
melting during the day in summer, and streams of clear water
are gushing along the ice, though, when night comes, these
streams freeze. At last it reaches some point in the valley beyond
which it can not go, for the warmth of the air there is melting
the ice as fast as it advances. So the glacier ends, and
from its melting extremity streams of muddy water unite into a
foaming river, which bears down the drainage of the snow-fields
above.</p>

<p>A river wears down the sides and bottom of its channel, and
thus digs out a bed for itself in even the hardest rock, as well
as in the softest soil. It sweeps down, too, a vast quantity
of mud, sand, and stones from the land to the sea. A glacier
performs the same kind of work, but in a very different
way.</p>

<p>When stones fall into a river they sink to the bottom, and are
pushed along there by the current. When mud enters a river
it remains suspended in the water, and is thus carried along.
But the ice of a glacier is a solid substance. Stones and mud
which fall upon its surface remain there, and are borne onward
with the whole mass of the moving glacier. They form long
lines of rubbish upon the glacier, and are called moraines.
Still the ice often gets broken up into deep cracks, opening into
yawning clefts or crevasses, which sometimes receive a good
deal of the earth and stones let loose by frost or otherwise from
the sides of the valley. In this way loose materials fall to the
bottom of the ice, and reach the solid floor of the valley down
which the ice is moving; while at the same time similar rubbish
tumbles between the edge of the glacier and the side of the
valley.</p>

<p>The stones and grains of sand which get jammed between
the ice and the rock over which it is moving are made to score
and scratch this rock. They form a kind of rough polishing
powder, whereby the glacier is continually grinding down the
bottom and sides of its channel. If you creep in below the ice,
or catch a sight of some part of the side from which the ice has
retired a little, you will find the surface of the rock all rubbed
away and covered with long scratches made by the sharp points
of the stones and sand.</p>

<p>You will now see the reason why the river, which escapes
from the end of a glacier, is always muddy. The bottom of the
glacier is stuck all over with stones, which are scraping and
wearing down the rock underneath. A great deal of fine mud
is thus produced, which, carried along by streams of water
flowing in channels under the glacier, emerges at the far end in
the discolored torrents which there sweep from under the ice.</p>

<p>A glacier is not only busy grinding out a bed for itself through
the mountains; it bears on its back down the valley enormous
quantities of fallen rock, earth and stones, which have tumbled
from the cliffs on either side. In this way blocks of rock
as big as a house may be carried for many miles, and dropped
where the ice melts. Thousands of tons of loose stones and
mud are every year moved on the ice from the far snowy
mountains away down into the valleys to which the glaciers
reach.</p>

<p>The largest glaciers in the world are those of the polar regions.
North Greenland, in truth, lies buried under one great
glacier, which pushes long tongues of ice down the valleys and
away out to sea. When a glacier advances into the sea, portions
of it break off and float away as icebergs. So enormous
are the glaciers in these cold tracts that the icebergs derived
from them often rise several hundred feet above the waves which
beat against their sides. And yet, in all such cases, about seven
times more of the ice is immersed under water than the portion,
large as it is, which appears above. You can realize how this
happens if you take a piece of ice, put it in a tumbler of water,
and watch how much of it rises out of the water. Sunk deep in
the sea, therefore, the icebergs float to and fro until they melt,
sometimes many hundreds of miles away from the glaciers
which supplied them.</p>

<p>You will come to learn afterward that, once upon a time,
there were glaciers in Britain. You will be able with your own
eyes to see rocks which have been ground down and scratched
by the ice, and big blocks of rock and piles of loose stones
which the ice carried upon its surface. So that, in learning
about glaciers, you are not merely learning what takes place in
other and distant lands, you are gaining knowledge which you
will be able by and by to make good use of, even in your own
country.</p>

<span class="smaller">FROM THE “CHRISTIAN’S PATTERN.”<br />
By THOMAS À KEMPIS.</span></h3>

<p>“He that followeth me walketh not in darkness, saith the
Lord.” These are the words of Christ, by which we are admonished
that we ought to imitate his life and manners, if we
would be truly enlightened and delivered from all blindness of
heart.</p>

<p>Let therefore our chief endeavor be to meditate upon the life
of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>What will it avail thee to dispute sublimely of the Trinity, if
thou be void of humility, and art thereby displeasing to the
Trinity?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Truly, sublime words do not make a man holy and just; but
a virtuous life maketh him dear to God.</p>

<p>I had rather feel compunction, than know the definition
thereof.</p>

<p>If thou didst know the whole Bible, and the sayings of all
the philosophers, by heart, what would all that profit thee without
the love of God?</p>

<p>Vanity of vanities! all is vanity, but to love God and serve
him only.</p>

<p>It is therefore vanity to seek after perishing riches.</p>

<p>It is also vanity to seek honors.</p>

<p>It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh, and to labor for
that for which thou must afterward suffer grievous punishment.</p>

<p>It is vanity to wish to live long, and to be careless to live
well.</p>

<p>It is vanity to mind this present life, and not those things
which are to come.</p>

<p>It is vanity to set thy love on that which speedily passeth
away, and not to hasten thither, where everlasting joys remain.</p>

<p>All men naturally desire to know; but what availeth knowledge
without the fear of God?</p>

<p>Surely an humble husbandman that serveth God is better
than a proud philosopher, that, neglecting himself, studies the
course of the heavens.</p>

<p>He that knoweth himself is vile in his own eyes, and is not
pleased with the praises of men.</p>

<p>If I understood all things in the world, and had not charity,
what would that help me in the sight of God, who will judge
me according to my deeds.</p>

<p>There are many things, to know which doth little profit the
soul.</p>

<p>And he is very unwise, that minds any other things than those
that tend to the welfare of his soul.</p>

<p>Many words do not satisfy the soul; but a pure conscience
giveth confidence toward God.</p>

<p>The more thou knowest, and the better thou understandest,
the more grievously shalt thou be judged, unless thy life be the
more holy.</p>

<p>Be not therefore lifted up; but rather let the knowledge given
thee make thee afraid.</p>

<p>If thou thinkest that thou knowest much: yet there are many
more things which thou knowest not.</p>

<p>Be not over wise, but rather acknowledge thine own ignorance.</p>

<p>The highest and most profitable lesson is, the true knowledge
of ourselves.</p>

<p>It is great wisdom to esteem ourselves nothing, and to think
always well and highly of others.</p>

<p>We are all frail, but remember, none more frail than thyself.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="DEC9">[<i>December 9.</i>]</h3>

<p>It is good that we be sometimes contradicted; and that men
think ill of us, and this, although we do not intend well.</p>

<p>For then we more diligently seek God for our inward witness,
when outwardly we are contemned by men.</p>

<p>Wherefore a man should settle himself so fully in God, that
he need not seek comforts of men.</p>

<p>When a man is afflicted, tempted, or troubled with evil
thoughts; then he understandeth better the great need he hath
of God.</p>

<p>So long as we live in this world, we can not be without temptation.</p>

<p>Hence it is written in Job, “The life of man is a warfare upon
earth.”</p>

<p>Temptations are often very profitable to men, though they
be troublesome and grievous; for in them a man is humbled,
purified, and instructed.</p>

<p>All the saints have passed through, and profited by, many
tribulations, and temptations:</p>

<p>And they that could not bear temptations, became reprobates
and fell away.</p>

<p>There is no place so secret, where there are no temptations.</p>

<p>There is no man that is altogether secure from temptations
while he liveth.</p>

<p>When one temptation goeth away, another cometh; and we
shall ever have something to suffer.</p>

<p>Many seek to fly temptations, and fall more grievously into
them.</p>

<p>By flight alone we can not overcome, but by patience and
humility we conquer all our enemies.</p>

<p>He that only avoideth them outwardly, and doth not pluck
them up by the roots, shall profit little: yea, temptations will
soon return unto him, and he shall feel them worse than before.</p>

<p>By patience (through God’s help) thou shalt more easily
overcome, than by harsh and disquieting efforts in thy own
strength.</p>

<p>Often take counsel in temptations; and deal not roughly
with him that is tempted.</p>

<p>The beginning of temptation is inconstancy of mind, and little
confidence in God.</p>

<p>For as a ship without a rudder is tossed to and fro with the
waves, so the man that is negligent is many ways tempted.</p>

<p>Fire trieth iron, and temptation a just man.</p>

<p>We know not often what we are able to do: but temptations
show us what we are.</p>

<p>We must be watchful, especially in the beginning of the
temptation; for the enemy is then more easily overcome, if he
be not suffered to enter the door of your hearts, but be resisted
without the gate at his first knock.</p>

<p>Wherefore one said, “Withstand the beginning: for an after
remedy comes too late.”</p>

<p>First, there occurreth to the mind a simple evil thought; then
a strong imagination; afterward delight; and lastly consent.</p>

<p>And so by little and little our malicious enemy getteth entrance,
while he is not resisted in the beginning.</p>

<p>And the longer one is slack in resisting, the weaker he becomes
daily, and the enemy stronger against him.</p>

<p>Some suffer the greatest temptation in the beginning of their
conversion; others in the latter end.</p>

<p>Others again are much troubled almost throughout their life.</p>

<p>Some are but slightly tempted, according to the wisdom which
weigheth the states of men, and ordereth all things for the good
of his elect.</p>

<p>We ought therefore, when we are tempted, so much the more
fervently to pray unto God; who surely will give with the temptation,
a way to escape, that we may be able to bear it.</p>

<p>Let us therefore humble ourselves under the hand of God, in
all temptations and tribulations; for he will exalt the humble in
spirit.</p>

<p>In temptations and afflictions a man is proved how much he
hath profited.</p>

<p>Neither is it any such great thing if a man be devout and fervent,
when he feeleth no affliction; but if in time of adversity
he bear himself patiently, there is hope then of great proficiency.</p>

<p>Some are kept from great temptations, and are overcome in
small ones; that being humbled, they may never trust themselves
in great matters, who are baffled in so small things.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="DEC16">[<i>December 16.</i>]</h3>

<p>Turn thine eyes unto thyself, and beware thou judge not the
deeds of other men.</p>

<p>In judging others a man laboreth in vain, often erreth, and
easily sinneth; but in judging and examining himself, he always
laboreth fruitfully.</p>

<p>We often judge of things according as we fancy them: for
affection bereaves us easily of a right judgment.</p>

<p>If God were always our desire, we should not be so much
troubled when our inclinations were opposed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>But oftentimes something lurks within, which draweth us after
it.</p>

<p>Many secretly seek themselves in their actions, but know it
not.</p>

<p>They live in peace of mind when things are done according
to their will: but if things succeed otherwise than they desire,
they are straightway troubled.</p>

<p>Diversity of inclinations and opinions often causes dissensions
between religious persons, between friends and countrymen.</p>

<p>An old custom is hardly broken, and no man is willing to be
led farther than himself can see.</p>

<p>If thou dost more rely upon thine own reason, than upon Jesus
Christ, late, if ever, shalt thou become illuminated.</p>

<p>The outward work without charity, profiteth nothing; but
whatsoever is done out of charity, be it ever so little and contemptible
in the sight of the world, is wholly fruitful.</p>

<p>For God weigheth more with how much love one worketh,
than how much he doeth.</p>

<p>He doth much that loveth much.</p>

<p>He doth much that doth a thing well.</p>

<p>He doth well that serveth his neighbor, and not his own will.</p>

<p>Often it seemeth to be charity, and it is rather carnality; because
natural inclinations, self-will, hope of reward, and desire
of our own interest, are motives that men are rarely free from.</p>

<p>He that hath true and perfect charity seeketh himself in nothing;
but only desireth in all things that God should be exalted.</p>

<p>He envieth none, because he seeketh not his own satisfaction;
neither rejoiceth in himself, but chooses God only for his
portion.</p>

<p>He attributes nothing that is good to any man, but wholly referreth
it unto God, from whom, as from the fountain, all things
proceed: in whom finally all the saints rest.</p>

<p>O that he had but one spark of true charity, he would certainly
discern that all earthly things are full of vanity!</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="DEC23">[<i>December 23.</i>]</h3>

<p>When one that was in great anxiety of mind, often wavering
between fear and hope, did once humbly prostrate himself in
prayer, and said, O, if I knew that I should persevere! he presently
heard within him an answer from God which said, If thou
didst know it, what wouldst thou do? Do what thou wouldst do
then, and thou shalt be safe.</p>

<p>And being herewith comforted and strengthened, he committed
himself wholly to the will of God, and his anxiety
ceased:</p>

<p>Neither had he any mind to search curiously farther what
should befall him; but rather labored to understand what was
the perfect and acceptable will of God, for the beginning and
accomplishing every good work.</p>

<p>Hope in the Lord, and do good, saith the prophet, and inhabit
the land, and thou shalt be fed.</p>

<p>One thing there is that draweth many back from a spiritual
progress, and diligent amendment; the horror of the difficulty,
or the labor of the combat.</p>

<p>But they improve most in virtue, that endeavor most to overcome
those things which are grievous and contrary to them.</p>

<p>For there a man improveth more, and obtaineth greater
grace, where he more overcometh himself and mortifieth himself
in spirit.</p>

<p>Gather some profit to thy soul wheresoever thou art; so if
thou seest or hearest of any good examples, stir up thyself to
the imitation thereof.</p>

<p>But if thou seest anything worthy of reproof, beware thou
doest not the same.—And if at any time thou hast done it, labor
quickly to amend it.</p>

<p>Be mindful of the profession thou hast made, and have always
before thine eyes the remembrance of thy Savior crucified.</p>

<p>Thou hast good cause to be ashamed, looking upon the life
of Jesus Christ, seeing thou hast as yet no more endeavored to
conform thyself unto him, though thou hast walked a long time
in the way of God.</p>

<p>A religious person that exerciseth himself seriously and devoutly
in the most holy life and passion of our Lord shall there
abundantly find whatsoever is necessary and profitable for him;
neither shall he need seek any better thing out of Jesus.</p>

<h4>A CHRISTMAS PRAYER.</h4>

<p>Come thou O Lord, and dwell within me, giving me light,
and love, and liberty. May the spirit of the sweet Christmas
Child possess me! May the Star of Bethlehem abide above
my dwelling place! May the angels who seek thee be drawn
toward me, and surround my path! May their song fill my
life. Glory to God in the highest. On earth peace, good will
to men.</p>

<p>This life will soon be at an end; consider therefore how thy
affairs stand as to the next.</p>

<p>Man is here to-day; to-morrow he is gone.</p>

<p>When he is out of sight, he is soon forgotten.</p>

<p>Thou shouldst so order thyself in all thy thoughts and all
thy actions, as if thou wert to die to-day.</p>

<p>Hadst thou a clear conscience, thou wouldst not fear death.</p>

<p>It were better to avoid sin than to fly death.</p>

<p>If thou art not prepared to-day, how wilt thou be to-morrow?</p>

<p>To-morrow is uncertain, and how knowest thou that thou
shalt live till to-morrow?</p>

<p>What availeth to live long, when we are so little the better?</p>

<p>Alas! long life doth not always mend us; but often increased
guilt.</p>

<p>O, that we had spent but one day well in this world!</p>

<p>When it is morning, think thou mayst die before night.</p>

<p>When evening comes, dare not to promise thyself the next
morning.</p>

<p>Be therefore always in readiness; and so live that death may
never take thee unprepared.</p>

<p>Many die suddenly, and when they look not for it; for “in
such an hour as you think not, the Son of man cometh.” Matt.
xxiv: 44.</p>

<p>When that last hour shall come, thou wilt have a far different
opinion of thy whole life.</p>

<p>How wise and happy is he, that laboreth to be such in his
life as he would wish to be found at the hour of his death.</p>

<p>Whilst thou art in health, thou mayst do much good, but when
thou art sick, I know not what thou wilt be able to do.</p>

<p>Few by sickness grow better; and they who travel much are
seldom sanctified.</p>

<p>Trust not in friends and kindred, neither put off the care of
thy soul till hereafter, for man will sooner forget thee than thou
art aware of.</p>

<p>If thou art not careful for thyself now, who will be careful
for thee hereafter?</p>

<p>The time present is very precious; now are the days of salvation,
now is the acceptable time.</p>

<p>But alas! that thou shouldst spend thy time no better here,
where thou mightest purchase life eternal. The time will come
when thou shalt desire one day or hour to amend in, and I can
not say it will be granted thee.</p>

<p>Ah fool! why dost thou think to live long, when thou canst
not promise thyself one day!</p>

<p>How many have been deceived, and suddenly snatched
away!</p>

<p>How often dost thou hear, such a man is slain, another is
drowned, a third has broken his neck with a fall; this man
died eating, and that playing?</p>

<p>One perished by fire, another by sword, another of the plague,
another was slain by thieves! Thus death is the end of all,
and man’s life suddenly passeth away like a shadow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>Who shall remember thee when thou art dead? Do, do
now, my beloved, whatsoever thou art able to do: for thou
knowest not when thou shalt die, nor yet what shall be after
thy death.</p>

<p>Now, while thou hast time, lay up for thyself everlasting
riches.</p>

<p>Keep thy heart free, and lifted up to God, because thou hast
here no abiding city.</p>

<p>Send thither thy daily prayers, and sighs, and tears, that after
death thy spirit may happily pass to the Lord. <i>Amen.</i></p>

<h3>III.<br />
<span class="smaller">EXCHANGE.</span></h3>

<p>1. Exchange is the mutual and voluntary transfer of the right
of property held by different persons. This implies, (<i>a</i>) the existence
of the <i>right of property</i>; (<i>b</i>) that the transfer must be
<i>mutual</i>, otherwise there is no exchange; (<i>c</i>) that it be <i>voluntary</i>,
otherwise it would be robbery.</p>

<p>2. The principles that form the basis of exchange are the
same as those implied in the great law of association and individuality;
namely, those which give rise to the combination
and division of labor. There is usually some one kind of labor,
or at most a few kinds, for which each individual is competent.
But the variety of occupations so nearly corresponds with
the variety of aptitudes in every well-ordered community, that
each may, with little effort, find the calling to which he is suited.</p>

<p>But while each individual is thus limited in his productive
capabilities, his claims and wants are nearly limitless. He is
in need of a thousand commodities, only a very few of which he
can produce. He depends for the remainder of these upon his
fellow-men. On the other hand, he can produce a thousand
times as much of the few kinds of commodities to which he devotes
himself, as he himself needs. These he transfers to his
fellow-men, taking in return the surplus of their several products.
This is exchange, or commerce. It is implied in the
very constitution of man. Association is an imperative condition
of humanity.</p>

<p>3. A distinction is sometimes made between <i>commerce</i> and
<i>trade</i>—a wise distinction, as it seems to me, though observed
by but few writers. The former is the <i>object</i> to be accomplished;
the latter is the <i>agency</i> through which it is accomplished. Thus,
a farmer has wheat, butter, eggs, poultry, wool, etc., which he
wishes to exchange for cloth, sugar, agricultural implements,
boots and shoes, and a hundred other articles. He can not go
to the several producers of these, carrying his own products to
exchange for them, except at immense disadvantage. Hence
arises the necessity for the trader, or merchant. Trade and
commerce have sometimes been represented as mutually antagonistic.
This is true only to a certain extent. The great
economical point to be guarded is to have no more traders than
are necessary to make the exchanges. When the industrial and
commercial conditions of a country are such that the producers
and consumers, who are the real exchangers, are placed and
kept at a great distance from each other, so that they can not
combine with each other except through the agency of a great
number of middle-men, the conditions are highly detrimental to
the interests of the parties chiefly concerned. Beyond a certain
point, the greater the power of trade, the worse it is for commerce.
It is nevertheless true that there are certain natural
obstacles to direct commerce which can be surmounted only by
some kind of intermediate agency; and this makes the trader
necessary. In this respect, and to this extent, trade is an aid to
commerce. Yet commerce should be as direct as possible. To
this end it is desirable that the greatest number of commodities
for which productive facilities exist, should be produced in the
same community.</p>

<p>4. The general law of exchange is <i>value for value</i>. This
will be obvious if we recur to one of our statements concerning
the nature of value, namely, that is the quantity of one commodity
that may be equitably exchanged for a given quantity
of another. It will be still more obvious if we recall the complete
definition: value is our estimate of the sacrifice requisite
to secure possession of a desired object. Thus, if it require the
labor of one day to produce a pair of shoes, and the labor also
of a day to produce three bushels of oats, then the rule of exchange
would be three bushels of oats for a pair of shoes, because
the required labor in the one case is precisely equal to that
in the other.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental law, but it is modified in its operation
by certain other facts and principles. Chief among these is the
law of <i>supply and demand</i>. By supply is meant the quantity of
any commodity which is in the market. Demand signifies the
quantity which is desired at a given price. The definitions are
sometimes erroneously given of supply as the quantity which
exists, and demand as the quantity desired. But a man may
offer for sale a load of wheat, provided the price is a dollar a
bushel, but withdraw it from the market if the price is but ninety
cents. A thousand people in a certain town may desire diamond
necklaces, but not half a dozen may be able to purchase
them. Hence supply is all that is offered in the market; and
demand is desire with ability to purchase.</p>

<p>Demand and supply affect prices in this way. Suppose a
community has been exclusively using wood for fuel, and their
wood can be had at a certain price. After a time a coal mine
is discovered in the vicinity, and coal can be furnished much
cheaper than wood. This would lessen the demand for wood.
As there would be the same amount for sale as before, the seller
would be in competition, and the price would fall. So if for
any reason before the discovery of the coal the supply of wood
had been diminished one half, the demand being the
same, the price would rise. Thus we have the general principle
that other things being equal, the greater the supply, the
less the price; the smaller the supply, the greater the price;
the greater the demand, the greater the price; and the
smaller the demand, the less the price. In other words,
the price varies directly as the demand, and inversely as the
supply. In general price varies as the cost of production plus
or minus the effect of supply and demand. These principles
are affected again in many ways which we can not here explain.
Yet the variations are always temporary, and the price or market
value always tends to seek the level of cost of production.</p>

<p>5. Trade has been spoken of as an agent of exchange. An
<i>instrument</i> also is needed. The primitive method of exchange
was by barter. That is, by giving the commodity one produces
for that which one desires to possess. But this was early
found inconvenient. The man who made shoes and wished to
exchange some of them for a coat, would not readily find a
coat-maker in want of shoes; or if he should, the latter very
likely would not want just so many pairs of shoes as would be
equal in value to the coat. All other exchanges might be at a
similar disadvantage. What is needed is a commodity which
will be a <i>medium</i> of exchange—which every one will be willing
to receive for any commodity which he has for sale, and
which will command anything which he wishes to buy. Such
a commodity is usually the main element in the machinery of
exchange, and is what constitutes <i>money</i>.</p>

<p>This instrument in order to meet the want, it is generally believed,
must have the following characteristics: 1. Value in the
material of which it is made. 2. Uniformity of value throughout
the world. 3. Much value in small bulk. 4. Approximate
constancy of value. 5. Not readily destructible. 6. Divisibility
into small portions which are capable of being reunited.
7. Of universal use. 8. Capable of receiving stamps and
marks. Most of these properties are found in gold and silver,
if not to such an extent as has been claimed for them, at least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
so far that they have been the basis of the money of the civilized
world.</p>

<p>6. But supplementing in a certain way, and representing
these, the instrument of exchange comprises also the large element
of <i>credit</i>. This consists chiefly of book accounts, promissory
notes, bank notes, government notes, bank deposits,
checks, drafts, bills of exchange, stocks and bonds. One of
the great agencies in modern commerce by which credit is made
effectual as a part of the mechanism of exchange is that of
<i>banks</i>. Banks are institutions which serve to abbreviate and
facilitate the business of exchange and to extend and render
available the credit of the community.</p>

<p>There are four kinds of banks, namely: savings banks,
banks of deposit, banks of circulation and issue, and banks of
discount. In our modern banking system the last three are
generally found in combination, that is, each bank exercises
all the functions implied.</p>

<p>A savings bank is an institution in which small sums of
money are deposited from time to time as they accumulate in
the hands of persons of moderate incomes. The depositors
are credited with these amounts, and receive a certain, usually
not very large, rate of interest in any case, and an additional
amount contingently. The bank loans the money thus deposited
in large sums to trustworthy persons who can furnish good
security, the rate of interest being somewhat higher than that
paid to the depositor.</p>

<p>The benefit of such an institution is two fold. In the first
place there are many persons who have small sums of money
which they desire to be earning something in some safe place.
The amount is too small to be loaned to advantage. Such persons
are not likely to know how, even if the sums at their disposal
were sufficient, to find the best investment, or to determine
concerning the security offered. But put into the hands
of men who make this their business, under rules devised by
the best financial talent of the community, and who can combine
these small sums and invest them to the best advantage, it
is made both safe and profitable for the small capitalists.</p>

<p>In the second place there are many persons who wish to unite
their labor and skill with capital in some productive enterprise,
and having no capital of their own, desire to borrow. They do
not know the persons who have money to loan. The savings
bank affords them an opportunity and gives them an advantage
which they would not otherwise have. It is a benefit first to
those who have some surplus, but are unable to loan it to advantage;
secondly to those who are in want of capital, but do
not know where to find it.</p>

<p>A <i>bank of deposit</i> grows out of the necessities of commerce
in a community where much business is transacted. All persons
engaged in trade will find from time to time large or smaller
accumulations of money in their hands which it is not safe
without considerable expense, to keep by them. Hence the custom
of depositing these for safe keeping in the bank. Usually
no interest is paid as the money may be withdrawn any time
at the will of the depositor. It was early found that only a
small proportion of these deposits were likely to be withdrawn
at any one time; hence a considerable proportion of them
could be loaned on short time, and thus the bank would in this
way receive compensation for its care, without expense to the
depositors. In this way, too, the capital of the community
could be kept more fully employed.</p>

<p>But the credit factor in the deposit system soon came to have
a much wider scope than is here indicated. Instead of each
depositor going to the bank and drawing his money as he needs
it, he now gives an order or <i>check</i> on the bank to any man to
whom he may have occasion to make a payment. In many
cases the receiver of such a check also has deposits at the same
bank. In such a case he sends in the check to be deposited
with his cash for the day. The amount is debited to the drawer
of the check, and credited to the depositor of it, and thus by a
simple <i>transfer</i> of <i>credit</i> much business is done without the intervention
of any money. This expands into a great and complicated
system of exchange between individuals doing business
at different banks, by banks in different cities, and by
traders in remote nations. Goods are sold in one locality and
paid for in the goods of another locality by means of drafts,
bills of exchange, etc., meeting and canceling one another,
so that very little money is transferred from point to point.</p>

<p>The function of <i>discount and loan</i>, as has been intimated, is
in modern banking usually combined with that of <i>deposit</i>, as
also that of <i>circulation or issue</i>. When the capital of a bank is
paid in by the stockholders, and the officers elected, it is then
ready for business under regulations imposed by its charter.
There are two ways in which the public is accommodated.
First, when a wholesale city merchant sells a bill of goods to a
country retail merchant, it is frequently the case that the former
makes out his bill, which the latter accepts, promising to pay in
thirty, sixty or ninety days. This accepted bill the wholesale
merchant carries to his bank, where it is received with his endorsement,
and the cash, less the interest for the given time, is
paid him or placed to his credit. This is <i>discounting</i> a bill. A
loan is sometimes made by a borrower’s giving his own note
endorsed by some reliable person, and payable in some brief
time as above. Sometimes the note is discounted; at other
times the interest is paid when the note is taken up.</p>

<p>The function of <i>circulation</i> is exercised by the issuing of
bank-notes to be circulated as money. When a bank is instituted
the stockholders are required to pay in their respective
shares in metallic or lawful money. But as the borrower would
find coin most inconvenient to carry about, the device arose of
substituting notes of the bank, payable on demand, thus leaving
the specie in the bank. It was further soon observed that
only a very small proportion of these notes were likely to be
called for at any one time. Hence a large part of the specie
could be used for other purposes instead of being kept idle in
the vaults. Under the national bank system now in operation
the capital of the bank may be largely invested in United States
bonds which are retained in the government treasury, but on
which the bank draws the usual interest. The bills of the bank
are then guaranteed by the government, so that there is never
any loss to the holder of the bills, even if the bank fails.</p>

<h4>PROTECTION AND FREE TRADE.</h4>

<p>7. We have space but for a very brief outline of this important
question. It is one which has for a long time agitated
the public mind, and one on which honest and highly intelligent
men widely differ. A <i>protective tariff</i> so called, is a system of
duties levied by the government of a country on certain commodities
produced in other countries to prevent their coming
into unequal competition with similar commodities of domestic
production in such a way as to cripple or destroy the industries
implied in the latter.</p>

<p><i>Free trade</i> is opposed to all those duties, the design of which
is to afford any advantage to domestic industry. It implies the
same freedom between producers in different nations as between
those in the same community.</p>

<p>The main arguments in favor of protection are as follows:</p>

<p>(1) It is the only sure defense of new and feeble industries
against the unequal competition of those long established in
other or older communities. Freedom of competition is admitted
as desirable, but it is denied that this exists under the conditions
referred to. A community which has long experience,
skilled labor, and accumulated capital, possesses great advantages
in the contest with a nation destitute of them.</p>

<p>(2) It is urged that a restrictive system gives a steady and
uniform market at an expense less than the benefit accruing.</p>

<p>(3) It is also supposed to be essential to societary completeness;
that is, to such a diversification of industry as will most
profitably meet the diversity of ability and aptitude in the community.</p>

<p>(4) It is thought to be necessary to the highest prosperity of
the unprotected interests. Among these agriculture is the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
prominent. It is for its advantage that the tax of transportation
be saved by having manufacturing communities in the
midst of agricultural areas. Also, a community compelled to
confine itself to agriculture mainly, must virtually transport its
soil, the land constantly diminishing in fertility.</p>

<p>The advocates of free trade, on the other hand, present the
following arguments in its favor, and objections against protection:</p>

<p>(1) Free trade is said to be the method of nature.</p>

<p>(2) It is objected that protection violates the right of every
man to do what he will with his own.</p>

<p>(3) It is said to be of the nature of a tax on all the other industries
for the support of those protected.</p>

<p>(4) It is objected that the restrictive system causes a diminution
of exports from the protected country, on the principle
that if the latter does not buy of the former, then the former can
not pay for the goods of the latter.</p>

<p>(5) Another argument is that “infant industries” under protection
never come to maturity.</p>

<p>(6) Finally, the case of the United States is cited as an instance
of free trade on a large scale between widely remote sections,
with the most satisfactory results.</p>

<h3>III.—MODERN SCULPTURE.</h3>

<p>The ten centuries following the second have no sculptural remains
of value. The dark ages threw their shadow over art,
as over literature and society. No doubt the feeling prevalent
in the early Church that the “graven image” might become an
idol, hindered the progress of the plastic art quite as much as the
general decay that pervaded every form of human undertaking.</p>

<p>In the first half of the thirteenth century lived Nicola Pisano,
the founder, one might say, of modern sculpture. Nicola is
supposed to have been influenced by his study of the remains of
Greek sculpture to be seen at Pisa, his home. Applying the
principles of the Greek work to the modern subjects, his sculpture
inaugurated the Italian renaissance. Church decoration
was the field of labor to which all artists of those centuries betook
themselves, and Pisano executed his best work, bas-reliefs,
on the façades and pulpits of the churches of Pisa, Siena, and
other Italian cities. A marble urn of St. Dominic, now at Bologna,
is among his celebrated works. Pisano had many followers,
among whom were his son (more famous, however, as an
architect), and Andrea Orcagna. The latter belonged to Florence,
to whose churches he devoted his genius. His masterpiece
in sculpture is the tabernacle of the Virgin in the church of
San Michele, at Florence. It is a pyramid-shaped altar in
white marble; the profusion of reliefs which cover it represent
the life of the Virgin. A little before the time of Orcagna lived
Giotto, at one time a leader of artistic activity in Florence. He
is known well by his beautiful campanile, or bell-tower, and the
bas-reliefs with which it is decorated are his best-known sculptures.
The basement story is decorated, and, says a writer,
speaking of these ornamentations, “This rich cycle of works represents
with perfect clearness, and in simple and truly artistic
treatment, the whole progress, from the creation of the first man,
through the successful conflict with the forces of nature, up to
the climax of a life illumined by learning and art, and secured
under the maternal shelter of the Church.”</p>

<p>It was in the fifteenth century that sculpture attained its highest
standpoint. Foremost among the artists of this “golden
age,” as it has been called, is Lorenzo Ghiberti, the Florentine.
The latter was first brought into prominence in 1401, when leading
men of Florence offered a prize for the best design for a
bronze folding door to be used in the baptistery of San Giovanni.
Each artist was allowed a year to complete the test panel, the
subject of the design of which was to be the “Sacrifice of Isaac,”
and the work was to be a bas-relief. Ghiberti was declared the
victor, even by his most famous rivals, Donatello and Brunelleschi.
For twenty-one years he labored at his doors, and at the
end of that time was entrusted with another. The latter occupied
him nearly as long as the first, and was even superior,
Michael Angelo declaring it worthy to be the gate of paradise.
While busy at the gate of the baptistery, Ghiberti executed three
bronze statues of St. John the Baptist, St. Matthew, and St. Stephen,
and a bronze sarcophagus of St. Zenobius. Donatello has
been mentioned as a rival of Ghiberti in the contest for the
door: he deserves mention as one of the most faithful followers
of nature during this period. He even carried his naturalism to
excess, copying the deformed, the horrible, and the grotesque.
There are, however, several fine statues by him in San Michele.
Among these are the statues of St. Peter and St. Mark, in niches
on the outside, and a fine statue of St. George. The first equestrian
statue of modern art was by Donatello, and is at Padua.</p>

<p>Lucca del Robbia lived at the same time, and his name is
associated with the beautiful terra-cottas found in such quantities
in the churches of Florence. These works are in white, on
a pale-blue ground, and were glazed by a process now unknown.
The subjects used on them were almost invariably the Madonna
and Child. But Robbia did much in marble and bronze. In
the Uffizi is to be seen a frieze for the front of an organ, by him.
“It represents boys and girls of different ages, dancing, singing,
and playing on various musical instruments, and is full of
charming simplicity and childlike grace, and rich and varied in
action. Some of the figures are almost wholly detached from
the background, particularly in the representation of the dance.”
There are many more names which might be added to this Tuscan
or Florentine school of sculpture. Andrea Verocchio is the
only one we will mention, and his strongest influence was exerted
as the teacher of that master-artist of the sixteenth century,
Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

<p>The works of the fifteenth century are very numerous; they
crowd the churches of Rome, Florence, and the neighboring
cities. Not only in Tuscany, but in Upper and Lower Italy these
artists were employed, and many native artists, imitators of the
school, have left sculptures on the tombs and in the churches of
Venice, Naples, and Como. The subjects of artistic effort, it will
be noticed, are nearly always religious. Lübke says of this period:
“It was chiefly devoted to the ornamentation of tomb-monuments
and altars, which, with few exceptions, were built
up against the wall in the shape of a triumphal arch, and required
much plastic decoration in the way of reliefs and detached
figures. Pulpits, founts, holy-water basins, singing-galleries,
and choir-screens were also adorned with rich carvings.
This abundant supply of work necessarily called forth a corresponding
amount of skill, and the nature of the subject helped
the artistic and realistic taste of the time to express itself. There
was a decided effort to attain a correct likeness in portrait-statues
of the dead, and in the numerous reliefs there was a tendency
to portray the varied scenes of life.”</p>

<p>But a new form of plastic art was to appear in the coming
century. To quote from the same author: “Italian plastic art
had during the fifteenth century gained a new form from the study
of the antique, and had made considerable advances in the unceasing
effort after truth and life.… But hitherto, the expression
of an often severe and tasteless realism was predominant, and
now, under the influence of a profound and repeated study of
the antique, an inspiration toward the ideal, the beautiful, and
the sublime, was to assert itself; and this gave rise to a higher
and freer style.… Plastic art gained a freer and nobler comprehension,
a broad, bold treatment of forms, and a style simplified
so as to bring out what was fundamental and essential,
which might, for a moment, compete with the antique.” Leonardo
da Vinci was one of the first in the list of masters of the
fifteenth century, but, unfortunately, we have lost his best work.
Andrea Contucci, better known as Sansovino, executed many
sculptures which are unparalleled in beauty of treatment and
form. In the baptistery at Florence is one of the noblest of these—the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
baptism of Christ. The figures of John the Baptist and
Christ are life-like, free, and perfectly developed. There is
nothing more interesting among what Sansovino has left than
the decorations of the Holy House of Loreto. “Taken as a
whole, this work is probably the most important collective creation
in the sculpture of this golden age.” There are a great
number of reliefs employed in the ornamentation, and the niches
are filled by single statues; of the former the Annunciation and
the Nativity are the most important.</p>

<p>But by far the ablest of the sculptors was Michael Angelo
Buonarroti, of Florence. It was as a sculptor that he chose to
regard himself, although, as in the case of so many of the Italian
artists, he was both a painter and architect beside. Numerous
works attributed to him are in existence. Mythological subjects,
as well as religious, are to be seen among them. Thus
there are bas-reliefs at Florence representing Hercules in his
contest with the centaurs, and a statue of Bacchus in the Uffizi.
The colossal marble statue of David in the academy at Florence,
is said to have been carved out of a rejected block. The
most ambitious undertaking of Michael Angelo was the mausoleum
of Pope Julius II. The designs were drawn on a grand
scale, and the master had gone to Carrara to get out the marble,
when a misunderstanding between him and the Pope stopped
the work. It was afterward re-attempted, but never finished.
Some of the detached figures intended for the tomb are
still seen. Among them the famous Moses, in the church of San
Pietro, at Vincolo. Two groups at Florence were executed for the
sarcophagi of Giuliano and Lorenzo de Medici. The statues of
the princes are seated in niches in the wall: at their feet, on the
lids of the coffins, are the groups: on that of the former the design
is Day and Night; on the latter Dawn and Evening. We
can mention no more of his designs, but will add the fine criticism
of a German critic: “If we compare Michael Angelo with
those who went before, we see at once that art reached one of
those turning-points at which it enters on a new period with an
undreamed-of future opening before. His deeply emotional
soul was content neither with the contemplative realism of the
fifteenth century, which was based on its truth to nature, nor
with the quiet, harmonious beauty of contemporaneous masters.
Each of his works exists for its own sake only, and here we see
a kinship with the antique. But again: each of them is also the
product of the stormy inward struggles of a man who is ever
aiming at the highest ideal, and untiringly striving after a new
expression of his thoughts—a man to whom achievement gave
but little satisfaction, so that often he left his works unfinished.
Here we see the strongest contrast to antique art. Nearly all
his sculptured works are in one sense or another incomplete,
and many he had to drop, because under the mighty stress of
his ideas, and in his eagerness to liberate from the marble the
slumbering soul within, he had made a false stroke and spoiled
the block.”</p>

<p>The influence of Michael Angelo was predominant. The
productions of almost every sculptor of the times were marked
by both his strong and weak points. The Michelangelesque
manner, as it has been called, was evident in the sculptures of
the following century.</p>

<p>Outside of this Tuscan school there were during the sixteenth
century several prominent artists; at Modena, Antonio Begarelli,
who worked mainly in terra-cotta, and who left many works in
the churches of his native city.</p>

<p>At Padua lived Riccio, who executed a bronze candelabrum
which has become famous for both its size and its excessive ornamentation.
It was eleven feet in height and laden with
innumerable fantastic reliefs and figures mostly taken from
mythology. A pupil of Sansovino, Jacopo Tatti, was the leader
in Upper Italy. He worked mainly at Venice. The bronze of
the sacristy of St. Mark in that city, the choir-screen in the
same church, and several figures of evangelists in bronze are
among his religious works. In the Doge’s palace are two large
statues of Mars and Neptune which are particularly fine. He
also did portrait-sculptures of much merit. But during this
century art was by no means confined to Italy, though Italy
then, as always, took the lead. In the North there was a steady
work in the plastic art. The influence of the antique was wanting,
and the materials in which the works were executed were
different. Wood carving was very popular; invariably much
gilding and brilliant coloring was used. The work was mainly
on the altars of the churches, on shrines, figures for niches in
the church walls and choir stalls. Michael Pacher, of Austria,
was eminent in this art; Veit Stoss, of Cracow, and Jörg
Syrlin, of Ulm. In nearly all of the old churches of Germany
are these highly colored carvings in wood.</p>

<p>But stone was used as extensively, and in a somewhat wider
variety of works. Many monuments, the buttresses of churches,
lecterns, doors, and choir-piers, were made in stone and decorated
in the usual manner by reliefs and figures. Nearly
all the German cities boast more or less of stone work in their
churches.</p>

<p>The leading artist of the time was Adam Krafft, who worked
mainly in Nuremberg. A very fine and powerful work by him
is the Seven Stations, as it is called. It represents the repeated
fainting of Christ beneath the burden of the cross. The work
is done in relief. The face and expression of the Savior is
noble and expressive in every case. This work was followed
by Christ on the Cross. In 1492 he executed the history of the
Passion for a monument on the exterior of St. Sebald’s church.</p>

<p>The monuments of the time are mainly very superior. Among
them may be mentioned that of Emperor Henry II. and his consort
by Riemenschneider, the marble monument of Bishop Rudolph
von Schrenburg in the Würtzburg cathedral, and the marble
memorial to the Emperor Frederic III. in Vienna. The
celebrated school of metal works of Nuremberg flourished during
this period. The best known representatives belonged to the
family of Vischer, and in Peter Vischer the most complete artistic
development was reached. The earliest work, by Hermann
Vischer in 1457, was the bronze baptismal font in Wittenberg.
Peter, his son, began his work on the tomb of Archbishop Ernst
in Magdeburg cathedral, but his <i>chef d’œuvre</i> was the tomb of
St. Sebald in the church of that saint at Nuremberg. Vischer
and his five sons were engaged on this for eleven years. The
sarcophagus rests on a base elaborately wrought in relief, and
the whole is enclosed; the cover is composed of three arched
canopies supported on eight slender columns. The base, pillars
and canopies are wrought exquisitely; although the ornaments
are profuse, yet a perfect simplicity and purity of style is
preserved. There are very many other productions attributed
to Vischer—a fine relief in the cathedral at Regensborg, several
tombs, and, as examples of his treatment of antique designs, an
Apollo at Nuremberg, and a relievo of Orpheus and Eurydice
in the Berlin Museum.</p>

<p>One of the most magnificent tombs of this period was that of
the Emperor Maximilian at Innsbrück; several of its figures
were from Peter Vischer’s hands. Twenty-eight colossal bronze
statues of the ancestors of the imperial house and of heroes surrounded
the monument. Besides these there were a large
number of gracefully poised female figures, and twenty-three
figures of the patron saint of the House of Austria. The whole
was surmounted by a marble cenotaph on which a figure of the
Emperor knelt. Several artists were engaged on this monument.
The sculptures of this period in other countries are not
very prominent. In France there was considerable attention
given to plastic art. Many fine choir-screens have been preserved,
and some exceedingly rich tombs. Among the latter
are the monuments of Louis XII. and his wife (1530), of Francis
I. (1552), and of Henry II. (1583), all in the church of St.
Denis in Paris. A set of artists who were engaged on the decorations
of the palace of Fontainebleau was known as “the
Fontainebleau school.” The leader of this group was Jean
Goujon. The sculpture of Spain during this period followed
largely the Italian schools. The most lavish treatment is visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in the decorations of the churches, particularly in the altars.
The high altar of the cathedral at Toledo is one of the most
costly and ornate of its time (about 1500).</p>

<p>“The seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were marked by a
decadence of sculpture. Plastic art sought to become striking,
rejected everything that could limit her art and gave herself up
freely to her longing after what was striking. Henceforth it
was decreed that every plastic work must be spirited. The
most striking effects must be aimed at in the expression of inward
emotion through mien, attitude and position.… Besides
the drapery must be arranged in all sorts of ways conducive to
effect.… Thus all dignity, simplicity and distinctness in
sculpture, all plastic style was lost, and was succeeded by a
senseless striving after outward effect and mere decoration.”
The best Italian artists of these years were Lorenzo Bernini
(1598-1680), who showed well the perversion of the principles
of art, and Alessandro Algardi. The French claimed as their
most celebrated masters in the seventeenth century, Pierre
Puget, who worked chiefly at Genoa, and François Girardon,
both of whom are noted for their exaggerations; in the eighteenth
century were Houdon and Pigalle.</p>

<p>Franz Duquesnoy, the Fleming, worked at Rome in the seventeenth
century and gained a fine reputation by his life-like
figures of children. In Berlin, Andrew Schlüter executed
superior works. Among these are the masks of dying warriors
carved above the windows of the court of the Arsenal. An
equestrian statue of the Great Elector is his best work.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the eighteenth century a revival of sculpture
took place; this has been attributed to the efforts of Popes
Clement XIV. and Pius VI., to the publications of Winckelmann,
and to the unearthing of the treasures of Pompeii and Herculaneum.
The first sculptor to initiate works of purer taste was
Canova (1757-1822); he came of a race of stone cutters, and
while at work at his trade executed the figures which attracted
the attention of a Venetian, who educated him for an artist.
Canova’s early works were mythological in subject. He had
studied sculptures unearthed at Pompeii and Herculaneum,
and under their influence executed his “Apollo crowning himself
with laurel” and “Theseus vanquishing the Minotaur.”
In 1802 Canova was invited by Napoleon to Paris where he
executed a colossal statue of the emperor. His figures of
women were his most pleasing works. Of the many monuments
he executed, the best is that of Christina in the church
of the Augustines at Vienna. But few artists escaped the influence
of Canova. Among his best known followers were Dannecker,
of Stuttgart; Chaudet, a French artist, and Flaxman,
an English sculptor.</p>

<p>For a brief outline of the sculptor of the nineteenth century
we can do nothing better than quote from Lübke:</p>

<p>The Danish artist, Bertel Thorwaldsen (1770-1844), penetrated
farther than all these masters into the spirit and the beauty
of classical art; and created, with inexhaustible fertility of imagination,
and with the noblest feeling for form, an array of
works which are conceived with a pure, chaste, and noble
appreciation of the Greek spirit. In his celebrated frieze of the
triumph of Alexander in the Villa Carlotta, on the lake of
Como, the genuine Grecian relief style is revived in all its perfect
purity and severity. He also treats with the versatility of
genius and with charming simplicity the subjects of ancient
mythology, in numerous statues, groups, and smaller reliefs;
and even introduces into the domain of Christian representation
a novel, beautiful, and dignified treatment, in the sculptures
executed by him for the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen.
Among his monumental works we may mention the
statues of Gutenberg at Mayence, and of Schiller at Stuttgart,
the Dying Lion at Lucerne, the equestrian statue of the Elector
Maximilian at Munich, and the tombs of the Duke of Leuchtenberg
in St. Michael’s Church at Munich, and of Pope Pius
VII. in St. Peter’s Church at Rome.</p>

<p>While the wide domain of idealistic sculpture was thus again
cultivated with such versatility of inspiration, the Berlin artist,
Johann Gottfried Schadow (1764-1850), adopted a more realistic
style, especially directed toward lifelike composition and distinct
characterization of individual peculiarities. His monument
of the Count von der Mark in the Church of Ste. Dorothy
in Berlin, the statue of Frederic the Great at Stettin, and, in a
less degree, the Blücher monument at Rostock, and that of
Luther at Wittenberg, as well as many others, are vigorous
protests against the mannerism of the hitherto prevailing tendency,
and re-open to sculpture a field which had now been
almost lost to her for two hundred years.</p>

<p>Thus a new path was opened to modern sculpture, in pursuing
which it has of late years accomplished great results, and
which assures to it still greater beauty, and diversity of attainment,
if only it hold fast to the principles already secured, and
go on with true dignity toward its goal. Even if the world of
ideal forms should never again acquire that importance for us
which it possessed for the Greeks, nevertheless the daily life of
humanity still contains a wealth of exquisite motives, full of
beauty and <i>naïveté</i>, which give to the sculptor’s fancy ample
incitement to ideal creations. There is, moreover, in the chaste
grace and pure dignity of the antique conceptions, an imperishable
charm, which appeals to every human sentiment, and
secures for all productions conceived in a similar spirit the
warm interest of those who delight to refresh themselves with
the simple beauty that belongs to every true manifestation of
nature. Hence the idealistic style of this art of Greece, as it
has been recognized by the present and endowed with new
activity, becomes forever the most priceless and precious possession
of modern sculpture.</p>

<p>The new-born historic feeling of the several nations demands
to-day that their heroes, the defenders of their liberties, the
representatives of their intellect, their warriors in the battles
both of the sword and of thought, shall be preserved to fame
in the true likeness of their actual forms. As a consequence,
sculpture is compelled to probe the depths of the individual
consciousness; to investigate the characteristics of each individual
intellect as expressed in the figure, the physiognomy,
and even in the externals of attitude and garb; and even to
give utterance to the mysterious life of the soul, as far as it lies
within her power. Without losing sight of the great importance
which the study of the sculptures of the fifteenth century has
upon this tendency, the influence of the antique should not be
undervalued; since, without the sense of beauty so secured, a
realistic degeneracy and exaggeration would be very sure to
follow.</p>

<p>Among the German schools of sculpture of to-day, that of
Berlin takes the lead. Frederick Tieck of this school adopted
the antique style in a series of admirable productions, and especially
in the decorative sculpture designed by him for the
theater; while the path which Schadow had taken was followed
up nobly and rationally during the long and influential labors
of Christian Rauch (1777-1857). This artist’s important position
is due less to his wealth of creative ideas than to his delicate
feeling for nature, his fine appreciation of the genuine
plastic style, and his incomparable care in execution. His
importance, however, does not consist merely in his numerous
works, but also in the influence he exercised on his large circle
of talented scholars. While he shows a true classical beauty
in his ideal works, like his victories and his many admirable
reliefs, his statues of Prince Blücher, of Generals Bülow and
Scharnhorst, his colossal equestrian statue of Frederic the
Great at Berlin, his superb statues of Queen Louise, and of
Frederic William III. in the mausoleum at Charlottenburg, his
bronze statues of Dürer at Nuremberg, of Kant at Königsberg,
of King Max I. at Munich, and many others, prove him a
sculptor of the first rank for delicate characterization, and life-like
suggestiveness of composition. Many excellent scholars
have gone from his studio into careers of independent importance
and masterly ability; and these form, with their vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
activity, which is never at a loss for employment in important
undertakings, the nucleus of the present school of Berlin.</p>

<p>Among the most conspicuous of the Berlin artists should be
reckoned Friedrich Drake, whose reliefs on the statue of Frederic
William III. in the Thiergarten at Berlin are full of simple
grace. Another of this school is Schievelbein (died in 1867),
who showed a great deal of imagination, especially in the composition
of reliefs; as in the great frieze representing the destruction
of Pompeii, in the new museum, and also in the relief
on the bridge at Dirschau.</p>

<p>Ernst Rietschel (1804-61) claims indisputably one of the first
places among the sculptors of his century, as regards versatility
of endowment, delicate feeling for form, and depth of sentiment.
He derived from Rauch his faithful and characteristic
representation of life, and his painstaking execution. His
double monument of Schiller and Goethe at Weimar, his monument
of Lessing in Brunswick (in a still purer and happier
style), and the statue of Luther executed for a monument at
Worms, are good examples of these traits. In the group of the
Virgin with the body of Christ, which he executed for the
Friedenskirche near Potsdam, he produced a work full of striking
expression, and of the deepest religious feeling; while the
subjects of his numerous representations in relief for the pediment
of the opera house at Berlin, and the theater and museum
at Dresden, represent him with equal dignity and merit
in the department of the ideal antique subjects. Ernst Hähnel
is a Dresden artist, whose powerful compositions for the Dresden
theater and museum are antique in treatment, but who
also produced monumental statues, works of the most delicate
characterization, such as the Beethoven at Bonn, the Emperor
Charles IV. at Prague, and the statues designed for the Dresden
Museum, especially the noble Raphael. Recently, also,
Schilling has distinguished himself by his ideal groups of the
divisions of the day,—Morning, Noon, Evening, Night,—designed
for the Brühl Terrace.</p>

<p>In Munich, the talented Ludwig Schwanthaler (1802-48) was
the chief representative of a more romantic style, which opened
a new field of fresh ideas to modern sculpture. This master,
who was endowed with an almost inexhaustible imagination,
carried out a great number of extensive works during his short
life, in supplying the plastic decorations for most of the buildings
erected by King Louis. While these are distinguished by
fertility of invention, and an excellent decorative taste, the
artist, spurred on to ceaseless labor, and hindered by bodily
infirmities, did not succeed in giving his monumental creations
that thorough development of form which is an essential of
sculpture. It can not be denied, however, that a grand monumental
conception is visible in these productions, as is especially
proved in the colossal statue of Bavaria in Munich. A
numerous school had its origin in this artist’s studio.</p>

<p>In France, sculpture early endeavored to free herself from
the rigid rule of the antique, and carried the prevailing effort
after dramatic effect, expression and passion, even to an extreme
point of realism. Individual artists have kept to a noble
and more moderate style; as Bosio, and the admirable sculptors
Rude and Duret; but, on the other hand, P. J. David d’Angers
(1793-1856) devoted himself, in utter violation of all the
severer laws of sculpture, to a violent realism, which, although
it is sustained by great talent and a charming facility in composition,
deteriorates into a lawless exaggeration in his monumental
works. His numerous portrait-busts, on the other hand,
are extremely lifelike, and full of genius. The Genoese artist,
James Pradier, takes the first rank among those sculptors who
especially delight in the representation of sensuous beauty
(1792-1852). The talented artist, Barye, who died in 1875, is
chief among the sculptors of animals. The sculpture of Belgium
follows the same general direction as the French.</p>

<p>Rome forms an important central point in the production of
modern sculpture, with her numerous studios, her skill in
marble-cutting,—an art handed down to her from ancient
times,—and her vast collection of antique works. Here Canova
and Thorwaldsen had their studios, which were for many decades
the most famous nurseries of modern sculpture. That
the antique conception and the idealistic style should acquire
especial prominence here lay in the nature of things. Only
where the modern social and political life exercises its full
powers does sculpture find tasks that call upon her for the
characteristic representation of important personages, and the
lifelike delineation of historical events.</p>

<p>The English artist, John Gibson, is conspicuous among the
sculptors of different nationalities who have made Rome their
headquarters, as the representative of a noble classic style.
The tendency of the numerous sculptors whom England has
recently produced is toward the genre-style, and toward graceful
forms in the manner of Canova. Macdonell, an artist of
much taste, and Sir Richard Westmacott, also well known by
his public works, deserve mention here, as well as R. J. Wyatt,
by whom we have some charming representations of subjects
chosen from the ancient myths. The United States of America
should also be included in this enumeration: for they possess
sculptors of decided talent in Randolph Rogers (who designed
the bronze gates of the Washington Capitol), Miss Hosmer, and
E. D. Palmer, who, though a gifted artist, inclines to an exaggeration
of the picturesque. Among the German sculptors in
Rome, Martin Wagner, who died in 1860, is worthy of note for
his energy of style; and, among those still living, Carl Steinhäuser,
now in Carlsruhe, is remarkable for an elevated feeling
for form, and depth of sentiment; while J. Kopf shows much
delicate grace; and the more recent artist, Ad. Hildebrand, has
a rare feeling for nature. Finally, Holland has an excellent
sculptor of the idealistic school in Matthias Kessels (1784-1830),
who studied under Thorwaldsen.</p>

of the giant champion of their enemies. A fire seizes him,
and he goes down to the army, with nothing but his sling, and
his heart of faith, to lay that champion in the dust. Next he is

calls it the principal good of their life, that they are to be Christians,
living to God and for the world to come. Then he goes
out into the field, or shop, or house of trade, and, delving there
all day in his gains, keeps praying from morning to night, without
knowing it, that his family may be rich. His plans and
works, faithfully seconded by an affectionate wife, pull exactly
contrary to the pull of his prayers, and to all their common
teaching in religion. Their tempers are worldly, and make a
worldly atmosphere in the home. Pride, the ambition of show,
and social standing, envy to what is above, and jealousy of what
is below, follies of dress and fashion, and the more foolish
elation, when a son is praised, or a daughter admired in the
matter of personal appearance, or, what is no better, a manifest
preparing and foretasting of this folly, when the son or daughter
is so young as to be more certainly poisoned by the infection
of it. Oh, these unspoken, damning prayers! how many they
are, and how they fill up all the days! The mornings open with
a reverent, fervent-sounding prayer of words; and then the
days come after piling up petitions of ends, aims, tempers, passions
and works, that ask for anything and everything but what
accords with genuine religion. The prayer of the morning is
that the son, the daughter—all the sons and daughters—may be
Christians; and then the prayers that follow are for anything
but that—in fact, for things most contrary to that. Is it any
wonder, when we consider this common disagreement between
the prayers of the family, and all other concerns, ends, and enjoyments
of the common life beside, that so many fine shows of
family piety are yet followed by so much of godless, and even
reprobate, character in the children?</p>

<h3 id="PORTER">DR. NOAH PORTER.</h3>

<h4>How to Read History.</h4>

<p>Whately pertinently observes, in his annotations upon Lord
Bacon’s “Essay on Studies:” “In reference to the study of history
I have elsewhere remarked upon the importance, among
the intellectual qualifications for such a study, of a vivid imagination.
The practical importance of such an exercise of
imagination to a full and clear, and consequently, profitable
view of the transactions related in history can hardly be over-estimated.”</p>

<p>To stimulate and aid the imagination in its efforts to reproduce
the past, historical plays and poems, and, more recently,
historical novels have been abundantly employed. Their usefulness
has been the subject of frequent discussion, and of
various opinions. It has been forcibly, and perhaps not untruly
said, that the majority of the present generation of English
readers have learned more of English history from Shakspere
and Walter Scott than from the entire library of professed historians.
Of course no man would contend that either Shakspere
or Scott could be substituted for the usual historical
authorities, but only that they may supplement them in certain
important particulars. Many other historical plays and novels
are invaluable as enabling the reader to enter more fully into
the spirit of past times. They are of especial service in helping
him to appreciate the feelings and motives of prominent personages,
and vividly to reproduce the manners and institutions
of another age. It is not often that an historical writer is
endowed with the painstaking zeal of the antiquarian, and the
creative power of the poet. If we can not have the two gifts
in a single writer, we must seek for them apart in the historian
and the novelist.</p>

<p>Thackeray’s “Henry Esmond” is an admirable example of
a good historical novel, when carefully and conscientiously
written by a man of rare gifts and of a rarer honesty. No
reader of this tale of the times of Queen Anne could fail to derive
from it such impressions of the state of manners and of
morals in the higher circles, as well as of the political jealousies
and the religious feuds which divided men of all classes, as
no formal history could possibly convey—such as even the
most abundant and painstaking research into the less accessible
resources of historical knowledge would fail to impart to a man
of feeble capacity to picture and recombine. The service is
not a slight one which is rendered to the world when such a
painstaking explorer of historical truth as Thackeray gathers
his materials with faithful and laborious research, and weaves
them together into so fascinating and instructive a story. But
this tale, marvelous as it is for its elaborated truthfulness and
picturesque effects, strikingly illustrates the possible dangers
and disadvantages to which the historical novel may be abused.
Thackeray was not without his prejudices. These, with his
desire for producing striking effects, are manifest in the occasional
<i>overdrawing</i> of this generally well-balanced representation
of one of the most interesting periods of English history.
It is notorious that Walter Scott gave very serious offense to
multitudes of his admiring readers by some of his portraitures
of the representative characters of the great historical parties
of Scotland and England. With all the good sense and candor
which he had at command, his sympathies were too intense
and his prejudices too tenacious to allow him to write otherwise
than he did, though he know he should excite the indignation
of thousands of his fervid countrymen. Mrs. H. B. Stowe says
in the preface to her recent historical romance, “Oldtown
Folks:” “I have tried to make my mind as still as a looking-glass
or a mountain lake, and thus to give you merely the images
reflected therein.” But a fervid and sympathetic nature like
hers can no more free itself from a theological or personal bias
in representing the New England of the past, over which she
has laughed, and wept, and speculated, and struggled all her
life, than the “mountain lake” can hold itself in glassy smoothness
against the gusts and breezes that sweep upon it from the
heights above.</p>

<p>The fact deserves notice that of late professed historians have
indulged somewhat freely in romancing, and so in a sense
turned their histories into quasi-historical novels, especially
when they attempt to give elaborate and eloquent portraitures
of the leading personages, in which the most lavish use is made
of effective epithets and pointed antitheses. Macaulay, among
recent historians, has set the fashion very decidedly in this
direction. In his efforts to make history minute, vivid, and
effective, he has often described like an impassioned advocate,
and painted, like a retained attorney, with the most unsparing
expenditure of contrasts and epithets. Carlyle gives sketches,
alternately in chalk and charcoal, that exhibit his saints and
demons, now in ghastliest white, and then in the most appalling
blackness. But though he draws caricatures he draws them
with the hand of an artist. Froude, by research, eloquence
and audacity combined, attempts to reverse the settled historic
judgments of all mankind in respect to characters that had
been “damned to everlasting fame.” Bancroft and Motley
abound in examples of this tendency to paint historical characters
so much to the life that the impression is made that the
result is only a painting to which there never was reality.</p>

<h4>A Rainy Sunday in an Inn.</h4>

<p>It was a rainy Sunday in the gloomy month of November. I
had been detained in the course of a journey by a slight indisposition,
from which I was recovering; but I was still feverish,
and was obliged to keep within doors all day, in an inn of the
small town of Derby. A wet Sunday in a country inn; whoever
has had the luck to experience one, can alone judge of
my situation. The rain pattered against the casements, the
bells tolled for church with a melancholy sound. I went to the
windows in quest of something to amuse the eye, but it seemed
as if I had been placed completely out of the reach of all
amusement. The windows of my bed-room looked out among
tiled roofs and stacks of chimneys, while those of my sitting-room
commanded a full view of the stable-yard. I know of
nothing more calculated to make a man sick of this world than
a stable-yard on a rainy day. The place was littered with wet
straw that had been kicked about by travelers and stable-boys.
In one corner was a stagnant pool of water surrounding an
island of muck; there were several half-drowned fowls crowded
together under a cart, among which was a miserable crest-fallen
cock, drenched out of all life and spirit, his drooping tail
matted, as it were, into a single feather, along which the water
trickled from his back; near the cart was a half-dozing cow,
chewing the cud, and standing patiently to be rained on, with
wreaths of vapor rising from her reeking hide; a wall-eyed
horse, tired of the loneliness of the stable, was poking his spectral
head out of a window, with the rain dripping on it from the
eaves; an unhappy cur, chained to a dog-house hard by, uttered
something every now and then between a bark and a
yelp; a drab of a kitchen wench tramped backward and forward
through the yards in pattens, looking as sulky as the
weather itself; everything, in short, was comfortless and forlorn,
excepting a crew of hard-drinking ducks, assembled like
boon companions round a puddle, and making a riotous noise
over their liquor.</p>

<p>I sauntered to the window, and stood gazing at the people
picking their way to church, with petticoats hoisted mid-leg
high, and dripping umbrellas. The bells ceased to toll, and
the streets became silent. I then amused myself with watching
the daughters of a tradesman opposite, who, being confined to
the house for fear of wetting their Sunday finery, played off
their charms at the front windows, to fascinate the chance tenants
of the inn. They at length were summoned away by a
vigilant vinegar-faced mother, and I had nothing further without
to amuse me.</p>

<p>The day continued lowering and gloomy; the slovenly, ragged,
spongy clouds drifted heavily along; there was no variety
even in the rain; it was one dull, continued, monotonous patter,
patter, patter, excepting that now and then I was enlivened by
the idea of a brisk shower, from the rattling of the drops upon
a passing umbrella. It was quite refreshing (if I may be allowed
a hackneyed phrase of the day) when in the course of
the morning a horn blew, and a stage-coach whirled through
the street with outside passengers stuck all over it, cowering
under cotton umbrellas, and seethed together, and reeking
with the steams of wet box-coats and upper benjamins. The
sound brought out from their lurking-places a crew of vagabond
boys and vagabond dogs, and the carroty-headed hostler, and
that nondescript animal yclept Boots, and all the other vagabond
race that infest the purlieus of an inn; but the bustle was
transient: the coach again whirled on its way; and boy and
dog, and hostler and Boots, all slunk back again to their holes;
the street again became silent, and the rain continued to rain
on.</p>

<p>The evening gradually wore away. The travelers read the
papers two or three times over. Some drew round the fire and
told long stories about their horses, about their adventures,
their overturns and breakings-down. They discussed the
credits of different merchants and different inns, and the two
wags told several choice anecdotes of pretty chambermaids and
kind landladies. All this passed as they were quietly taking
what they called their nightcaps; that is to say, strong glasses
of brandy and water or sugar, or some other mixture of the
kind; after which they one after another rang for Boots and
the chambermaid, and walked off to bed in old shoes cut down
into marvelously uncomfortable slippers. There was only one
man left,—a short-legged, long-bodied plethoric fellow, with a
very large sandy head. He sat by himself with a glass of port
wine negus and a spoon, sipping and stirring, and meditating
and sipping, until nothing was left but the spoon. He gradually
fell asleep bolt upright in his chair, with the empty glass
standing before him; and the candle seemed to fall asleep too,
for the wick grew long and black, and cabbaged at the end,
and dimmed the little light that remained in the chamber.
The gloom that now prevailed was contagious. Around hung
the shapeless and almost spectral box-coats of departed travelers,
long since buried in deep sleep. I only heard the ticking
of the clock, with the deep-drawn breathings of the sleeping
toper, and the drippings of the rain—drop, drop, drop—from
the eaves of the house.</p>

<h4>Irving’s Last Interview with Scott.</h4>

<p>It was at Sunnyside, on a glorious afternoon in June, 1855,
that surrounded by scenery which Irving has best described,
he narrated to me (S. Austin Allibone) the following account of
his last interview with Scott:</p>

<p>“I was in London when Scott arrived after his attack of
paralysis, on his way to the continent in search of health. I
received a note from Lockhart, begging me to come and take
dinner with Scott and himself the next day. When I entered
the room Scott grasped my hand, and looked me steadfastly in
the face. ‘Time has dealt gently with you, my friend, since we
parted,’ he exclaimed:—he referred to the difference in himself
since we had met. At dinner, I could see that Scott’s mind
was failing. He was painfully conscious of it himself. He
would talk with much animation, and we would listen with the
most respectful attention; but there was an effort and an embarrassment
in his manner; he knew all was not right. It was
very distressing, and we (Irving, Lockhart, and Anne Scott)
tried to keep up the conversation between ourselves, that Sir
Walter might talk as little as possible. After dinner he took
my arm to walk up-stairs, which he did with difficulty. He
turned and looked in my face, and said, ‘They need not tell a
man his mind is not affected when his body is as much impaired
as mine.’ This was my last interview with Scott. I heard afterward
that he was better; but I never saw him again.”</p>

<p>Two years later (in 1857), in narrating the same event, Irving
told me that as Scott passed up the stairs with him after dinner,
he remarked, “Times are sadly changed since we walked
up the Eildon hills together.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time a Destroyer.</span>—I saw a temple, reared by the hands
of man, standing with its high pinnacle in the distant plain.
The streams beat about it; the God of nature hurled his thunderbolts
against it; yet it stood firm as adamant. Revelry was
in the halls; the gay, the young, the beautiful were there. I
returned, and lo! the temple was no more. Its high walls lay
scattered in ruin; moss and grass grew rankly there; and, at
the midnight hour, the owl’s long cry added to the solitude.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
The young, the gay, who had reveled there, had passed away.
I saw a child rejoicing in his youth, the idol of his mother, and
the pride of his father. I returned and the child had become
old. Trembling with the weight of years, he stood the last of
his generation, a stranger amidst all the desolation around him.
I saw an old oak standing in all its pride upon the mountain;
the birds were caroling in its boughs. I returned and saw
the oak was leafless and sapless; the winds were playing at
their pastime through the branches. “Who is the destroyer?”
said I to my guardian angel. “It is Time,” said he. When
the morning stars sang together for joy over the new-made
world, he commenced his course, and when he has destroyed
all that is beautiful on the earth, plucked the sun from his
sphere, veiled the moon in blood; yea, when he shall have
rolled the heavens and the earth away as a scroll, then shall an
angel from the throne of God come forth, and, with one foot
upon the land, lift up his hand toward heaven, and swear by
heaven’s eternal, “time was, but time shall be no more.”</p>

<h2 id="EDUCATION_OF_THE_NEGRO_POPULATION">EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO POPULATION.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By ATTICUS G. HAYGOOD, D.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>FACTS ON THE SURFACE.</h3>

<p>The records in the Department of Education, in Washington
City, show that in the recent slave States of the Union the total
school population was, in 1881, 5,814,261. Of these, 3,973,676
were white; 1,840,585 colored children. Counting both races
the total school enrollment for 1881 was 3,034,896; of these
2,232,337 were white, 802,559 colored children. Nearly half the
white, and more than half the colored school population was,
in 1881, out of school. In some of these States the school term
is from three to five months; in the cotton States not more than
three. Perhaps five months each year is as long a school term
as the conditions and needs of the laboring classes in these
States will allow.</p>

<p>In 1881 these States expended upon their public schools
$13,359,784; except perhaps in one state this money was expended
without distinction of race. The races have schools of
their own; doctrinaires would mix them by force of law; those
who are actually doing the work of education in these States
know that this can not be done, and that only harm would
come of it, if the experiment were attempted. For neither race
would do so well if taught together; the colored children do
not desire mixed schools, and the white children will not attend
them. In such conditions law is helpless, and force is
folly; also ruin.</p>

<h3>OTHER FACTS.</h3>

<p>The official figures give the numbers; parole evidence is necessary
to complete the statement of the case. In 1881 there
were, as the Department of Education reports, in the Southern
States 17,248 common schools for colored children. With exceptions
so few that they are inappreciable in these statements,
the teachers in these 17,248 common schools were colored—the
large majority being women. The majority of these teachers
are pitiably incompetent; some of them are well furnished for
their work, and are doing it faithfully and successfully. Nearly
all of these colored teachers who are of any use have received
their preparation in the various schools for higher instruction
established by societies and churches in the Northern States.
Some of the best work is done in schools established and carried
on by individual devotion—I will not say enterprise.
Taking them all together there are nearly one hundred and
fifty of these schools, called, as fancy or circumstances
prompted or allowed, universities, colleges, institutes, seminaries,
normal schools, etc., etc. There is hardly an “academy”
among them.</p>

<h3>OVER-NAMING.</h3>

<p>Many will think me wrong in the opinion I now offer; some
of the wisest of the teachers in the real work of teaching negroes
will agree with me: it is a misfortune that the names given
these schools are so out of proportion to their real work and
character. None of them, even in catalogues, go beyond the
ordinary college course; many of them do not come up to it;
in none of them do more than a very small number complete
this course. There is not a university, in any proper sense,
among them all. It is not in the spirit of censure that I speak
of these things, but of deep interest in the great and necessary
work, that the good people engaged in these schools are trying,
with rare consecration and in the teeth of a thousand discouragements,
to accomplish.</p>

<p>The great names for these schools have done harm. They
are misleading to begin with, and that is an evil. It is hard
enough to get the indifferent or the antagonistic people to understand
the subject of the education of the negroes at best; it
is harder when new meanings have to be given to old names
in order to state acts. I am of the opinion that the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
given to most of these schools have done some harm in the
North—whence the money has been drawn to support them.
Northern men have sometimes spoken to me on these subjects
in language that made it plain that they would have helped
more but from a conviction that “schools and not universities
are what these poor people need.” <i>Per contra</i>, it may well
enough be answered, some have given largely to build “universities”
that would not give to establish schools. As to the
influence on northern sentiment of the <i>too-great names</i>, those
who know that sentiment better than I do can express themselves
more definitely. I know that the big names have done
harm in the States where the schools are. At this point let me
say, I am only stating what I believe to be facts. Comments,
inferences, justifications, do not concern me just now.</p>

<p>First, then, the large names have excited prejudice among
the white people who did not know what was back of the
names. Most of them, for a long time, did not know what the
universities and colleges were really trying to do; the majority
do not know at this time.</p>

<p>Some of those who did know something thought the whole
business a mere sham; for a long time only a few southern
white people really knew that faithful, wise and successful
teaching was done in these colleges and universities—most of
it not being college or university work at all. The few who
really knew what good work was being done could over-look
the ambitious names—it being a weakness in the South and
West, yielded to by not a few, to give great names to small
schools for white youth. The wiser and kinder-hearted ones
could condone the offense of over-large names in view of their
own example.</p>

<p>The big names did as much as anything else to anger the
poor whites against all negro education. People who know
human nature will understand this statement without explanation:
those who do not know human nature will not understand
it anyway.</p>

<p>The worst evil, in the long run, of this big naming of schools
for the negroes, fell upon the negroes themselves. It aggravated
the tendency—very strong among them—to be satisfied
with the name of a thing in the lack of the thing itself, and,
what is more, not knowing that they can lack the thing when
they have the name. Take, for example, “⸺ University,”
an admirable school well known to me. Its annual enrollment
will average three hundred; its catalogue course reaches
from the primary studies through an ordinary college curriculum;
one in ten attempts this college course; one in
fifty may complete it. The whole three hundred tell their
friends: “I was educated in ⸺ University.” It gives them
importance. They pass as scholars beyond their merits among
their own people. In many of them it breeds injurious conceits—of
a sort that makes enemies of those who might be
friends, and prejudices with the uninformed—who in all countries
are the majority—the whole subject of negro education.
It is to be feared that only a few colored students know the difference
between “⸺ University” and a real university.</p>

<h3>NO SHAM IN THE WORK DONE.</h3>

<p>Let me say with emphasis at this point: there is no sham in
the work done in these schools. It is genuine, honest, useful
work. This is a general statement; there may be, doubtless
are, some schools that do not deserve this praise. But the
point I wish to make plain to the readers of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
is this: if there be sham it is not in the work done, but in the
name given the place where it is done. I asked one of the veterans:
“Why did you call this school a university?” He answered:
“We hoped it would grow to it some day.” How
could I blame the hopefulness of those who did the naming?
So many of our white schools had been named under the same
sort of prophetic impulse.</p>

<h3>TRAINING SCHOOLS.</h3>

<p>It is those schools backed by the churches and benevolent
societies of the North that are doing the most of the work of
preparing teachers among the colored people for the colored
people. The very best of the more than seventeen thousand
colored teachers have learned whatever they know in these
schools. Most of the Southern State governments have recognized
the necessity of preparing colored teachers, and make
annual appropriations to carry on this work. A few States
have established schools of their own; generally they make
appropriations to some of the best of the schools established
by others.</p>

<p>The great and crying need in the work of education among
the people is better teachers in their common schools. They
can not be prepared in a day or a year; for it takes much
money and much time. The training schools are without endowments,
and their patrons are unable to pay more than the
lowest tuition fees. If these schools—call them universities,
colleges, institutes, seminaries—what you will, are to keep going
at their present rate, to say nothing of improvement, white
people must furnish the money, for the best of reasons; the negroes
have not money to do this sort of work. Most of this
money will have to come from Northern pockets, if it comes at
all. The State of New York is worth more in property returned
for taxation than all the Southern States together—leaving out
Missouri, counted in the census of 1880 among “Western
States.”</p>

<h3>THE JOHN F. SLATER FUND</h3>

<p>Begins to do its blessed work. This fund is dedicated to the
work of “Uplifting the lately emancipated population of the
Southern States and their posterity, by conferring on them the
blessings of Christian education,” and it seeks to accomplish
this result by “the training of teachers among the people requiring
to be taught.” This fund works through existing institutions;
it does not found new schools; there are already more
good and deserving schools than it can help. Many times the
sum this fund affords could be wisely used.</p>

<p>There is not space in this article to discuss the question, but
my opinion may be stated: It is necessary that the United
States government should aid the States to make their public
schools more efficient. Whatever may be true of other sections,
the Southern States, owing to the facts of their history
and to conditions now existing, are not able to do the work that
is upon them.</p>

<p>As to the sentiment in these States on the subject of negro
education, it may be said in brief: The outcry of small village
papers does not always even reflect the sentiment of the people,
and there are certain facts that indicate that the work of
educating the negroes will go on with less and less hindrance.
Three such facts I mention in closing this article: (1) The
duty and necessity of educating the negro has been recognized
by every representative church in the South. (2) This necessity
is recognized in the educational system of every Southern
State. (3) No man who believes he has any political or educational
“future,” any longer opposes, under his proper name,
the education of his negro fellow citizens.</p>

<p>Dress changes, but we are not to suppose on that account
that the make of the body changes also. Politeness or rudeness,
knowledge or ignorance, more or less of a certain degree
of guilelessness and simplicity, a serious or playful humor;
these are but the outer crust of a man, and may all change;
but the heart changes not, and the whole of man is in the heart.
One age is ignorant, but the fashion of being learned may
come; we are all moved by self-interest, but the fashion of being
disinterested will never come. Amidst the countless
myriads of creatures born in the space of a hundred years,
nature may perhaps produce two or three dozen of rational
beings whom she must scatter over the world, and you can
readily imagine that they are never found any where in such
large numbers as to set the fashion of virtue and uprightness.—<i>Fontenelle.</i></p>

<p>I wonder if men could not be persuaded to alter their style of
conversation with girls, to talk to us as they talk to men?</p>

<p>We have a feeling that learned young men are the dullest of
talkers; not because they talk weightily; Oh, no! because they
talk so lightly, and lightness is not their forte.</p>

<p>A diligent student, a very cormorant, perhaps, of knowledge,
dons a white necktie and sallies forth, and resolutely leaves behind
for the evening every material he has wherewith to make
himself agreeable. He is not witty, he is too busy to be a gossip,
he is too little in company to learn an easy jog of commonplace
or compliment. So he sits on a sofa, and the girl
makes some opening remark, to which he replies with studied
interest; and at the pause she magnetically feels that it is best
to make a longer remark this time. If she were talking to a
lad, she might drift into expressing some of her real ideas, and
find profit and pleasure in airing them; but for the amusement
of this young savant, by no means. Still, at his next turn to
speak, or the next, she has come suggestively near some subject
worth talking of; if he were with a man he would instantly
plunge in, and in five minutes they would be deep in discussion
or description, sharpening their wits by every sentence,
fixing what they have read, shaping their crude opinions, thoroughly
enjoying each other; and for this they need not be
equals in cultivation, nor altogether equals in mind.</p>

<p>Why should it be so different when talking with a woman?
There is no reason, but habit. One says, “People dislike to
talk shop; the busy scholar wants a rest.” On the contrary,
most people, I think, would rather talk shop than anything else.
If it is their life interest and their strong point, they have so
much more to say. The truth is, they fear that the listener will
object, and so “in company” they avoid it. I wager the listener
would be delighted.</p>

<p>I do not write so much to those who can get up at will a brilliant
flow of mere scintillation. That is a scarce enough article
to be valuable. Yet they might use it occasionally on
sense as well as on nonsense, and make themselves all the
more notably entertaining.</p>

<p>I once knew a grave professional man who was said to be
both clever and cultivated, but for me there seemed no possible
way to enjoy him. His visits were the most empty occasions.
He was “a desirable person to be visited by,” but he was unendurable;
though he did not fail to be politely attentive in
more ways than one. I was glad he was going away. Just then
a mutual friend came on the scene, who had views on this matter.
I know she gave him the benefit of them, as well as if she
had told me; for such an amazing change I never saw. The
passive sitter waked up, the bore became a charming talker,
and all because he had taken his own permission to be agreeable
in his natural way. I was so sorry when he left town!</p>

<p>That instance of transformation is what inspires my appeal.
The thing would seem grounded and settled, incapable of cure,
but what one exhortation can accomplish has been proved.</p>

<p>And it is a case in which the butterfly may well spring full-colored
from the chrysalis, for the stuff that talk is made of is all
there; not repartee, of course, or always brilliant expression for
one’s thoughts and facts; but thoughts and facts very simply
used make an evening world-wide different from a succession
of laboriously-framed sentences carefully intended to be about
something in which the man does not take any interest, and the
woman sees he does not. Can we wonder that the sand-man
has to be struggled with many a time by both parties? Young
boys do not blink with sleep under your very eyes; but full-grown
men often do, and largely because they insist on pursuing
at thirty-five about the same topics of conversation that they
used at eighteen.</p>

<p>Don’t you, Mr. Dry-as-dust, want to turn over a new leaf?
My opportunities of learning are limited, perhaps, while yours
are constant. If I am to spend an hour, or two or three, with
you, will not you give me some advantage from your well-furnished
store-house? If I do not respond then possibly you
may stand excused, and never again run the risk of talking
over my head.</p>

<p>But give me one fair trial, and see if we are not “better company”
and better friends ever afterward.</p>

<p>The hedgehog, like the bat, is carnivorous.</p>

<p>Toward the end of autumn it looks out for some retired spot,
a perfectly dry cavity in the ground or in the rock being the
favorite resort. Here it gathers together a large quantity of
dry moss, leaves, grass, etc., covers itself with them, rolls itself
into a ball, and sinks into the hibernating lethargy.</p>

<p>It is rather remarkable that a hibernating animal is much
more sensitive to a slight touch than to general handling. If,
for example, a single hair of a hibernating bat or a single quill
of a hibernating hedgehog be raised, the creature gives a quick
start, and takes a few breaths before relapsing into lethargy.
Yet a bat may be sunk under water, or have a thermometer
tube passed into its stomach, without being awakened.</p>

<p>When a hibernating bat is sunk under water of the same temperature
as that of its body, it does not even attempt to breathe.
A similar experiment was tried with a hedgehog, and after it
had been under water for twenty-one minutes, one tiny bubble
of air rose to the surface. I need scarcely say that if the animal
had been awake, it would have been drowned in less than a
fourth of the time.</p>

<p>For the bat, no food can be found until the warm weather returns,
and so the hibernation is unbroken for at least five
months. But, though food be almost entirely withdrawn from
the hedgehog, some nutriment remains, and therefore the animal
is so constituted that it can discover and consume the food
which has been provided for it.</p>

<p>This food chiefly consists of snails, which are themselves hibernators,
and which during the winter months conceal themselves
so effectually that they are seldom detected except by
their two great wintry foes, the thrush and the hedgehog.</p>

<p>The hedgehog, not possessing so wide a range of hibernating
temperature as the bat, which actually “hibernates” daily for a
short time even during the hottest summers, is roused by an
hour or two of warm sunshine such as we often experience
about February. Awakened by the warmth, the hedgehog unrolls
itself, creeps out of its refuge, and trundles (I know no
better word to describe its peculiar pace) away in search of
food. Taught by instinct, it is sure to come upon one of the
strongholds of the snail, eats as many as it needs, returns to its
home, and sleeps until awakened in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Then we have the vegetable-eating squirrel, which is a partial
hibernator.</p>

<p>During the later weeks of autumn, the squirrel may be seen
in the act of making provision for the winter. In the first place
it collects a vast store of fallen leaves, moss, twigs, and similar
materials, and with them constructs its winter nest.</p>

<p>Squirrels have two distinct kinds of nest, one for the winter
and the other for the summer. Both nests are of considerable
size, and both are so well concealed that to detect them is a
very difficult task. The summer nest is comparatively light in
texture, and is placed near the ends of lofty boughs, where it is
hidden by the leaves. Moreover, its position renders it almost
unassailable, as the branch on which it is built would not even
endure the weight of a small boy. In the winter, when the
leaves are off the trees, the nests are very conspicuous, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
the New Forest, where I gave some time to watching the habits
of the squirrel, they are exceedingly numerous.</p>

<p>In fact, the squirrels of the New Forest swarm in such numbers,
and do so much damage to the young twigs of the trees,
that many hundreds must be shot annually, just as is the case
with rabbits. They are always shot just before hibernating,
because, as they put on new robes for the winter, their skins
fetch the best prices. Moreover, the animals become fat, as is
the case with all hibernators, and so their flesh is in good condition
for the table. Squirrel-pie is a well-known luxury in
some parts of England, and is far superior to rabbit-pie, as it is
free from the peculiar flavor which attaches itself to the rabbit,
and to many persons is exceedingly repulsive.</p>

<p>The winter nest is a very large one, containing at least four
or five times as much material as would serve for a summer’s
nest. Instead of being placed at the end of a bough, it is always
set in the hollow caused by the junction of several large
branches with the trunk. The exterior is so skilfully formed,
that when the tree is viewed from below, even the most practised
eyes will often fail to detect the nest, large as it is.</p>

<p>The amount of material which a squirrel employs in this nest
is really wonderful. I have taken out of a single nest armful
after armful of leaves, until quite a large mound was raised at
the foot of the tree, and I should think that there was enough
material to fill two large wheelbarrows, even if it were pressed
down closely.</p>

<p>I may here mention that the nest of the squirrel is known in
some parts of England by the name of “drey,” and in others
by that of “cage.” The latter term is employed in the New
Forest.</p>

<p>The house being ready, next comes the task of laying up a
store of food. This consists chiefly of nuts, which the animal
chooses with marvelous sagacity, or rather, instinct. No one
ever yet found an unsound or worm-eaten nut in a squirrel’s
store. The animal does not rely on a single storehouse, but
hides its treasures here and there within easy range of its nest.
Many nuts it buries, and owing to this habit, nut-trees are apt
to spring up in unexpected places, for, if the weather should
be exceptionally severe, the squirrel awakens but seldom from
its winter sleep, and so does not need the store which it has
hidden. Or, it may die or be killed after it has laid up its food,
and so the buried nuts will take root and produce trees.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance of this fact occurred in the grounds of
Walton Hall, belonging to the late Charles Waterton.</p>

<p>In former days there had been in the estate an old wooden
mill. It had been disused for many years, and at last the only
relic of it was the upper millstone which was left on the ground.
The reader may be aware that the center of the upper stone is
pierced with a tolerably large hole, through which the corn
makes its way between the stones.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1813, some nut-eating, hibernating animal,
almost certainly a squirrel, had found this stone, and thought
that the hole would make an admirable hiding-place for a nut.
For some reason, the nut was never eaten, and consequently
began to germinate. Mr. Waterton, who pervaded his grounds
at all hours of day and night, detected the green shoot at once
when it appeared in the spring of the following year. Foreseeing
that the shoot, if it lived long enough to become a tree,
would raise the stone from the ground, he had a fence put
round it, and gave special orders for its preservation.</p>

<p>His prevision proved to be perfectly correct. In course of
years, the little shoot became a large tree twenty-five feet in
height, and bearing fine crops of fruit annually, and Mr. Edmund
Waterton told me that in his boyhood he had often
climbed it for the purpose of procuring nuts. After the stem
was large enough to fill the orifice in which it had been planted
it lifted the stone, and raised it some eight or nine inches above
the ground.</p>

<p>As might be imagined, in the course of years the pressure of
the stone destroyed the bark, and stopped the circulation of the
sap, so that the tree died. In order to save it from being blown
down, the trunk and branches were cut away some feet above
the stone. On my last visit to Walton Hall, shortly before Mr.
Waterton’s death, the stone was still suspended above the
ground, and as a memorial of so remarkable a result of hibernation,
I made a careful sketch of it, which was published by
Messrs. Macmillan.</p>

<p>It is also noticeable as an example of the slow, silent, and
almost irresistible power of vegetation. Even the soft and
pulpy mushroom has been known to raise a flat, heavy paving-stone
fairly off the ground. Had the mushrooms been allowed
to grow, and the paving-stone laid on them, it would have
crushed them under its weight. But the vital powers of growth
are so tremendous, even when acting upon so feeble a medium,
that they performed a feat which would have been thought impossible
had it not been witnessed.</p>

<p>In some parts of South America, where the growth of vegetation
is surprisingly rapid, there used to be, and may be still,
a mode of inflicting capital punishment by the power of vegetation.
We all know the sharply-pointed and bayonet-like
leaves of certain aloes. The victim was simply fastened to the
ground over a spot where an aloe was just starting from the
earth, and before a day had gone by, the leaves would grow
completely through the body.</p>

<p>I briefly mention these examples in order to show how all nature
is linked together, and that the hibernation of animals and
the growth of vegetables are parts of one great system.</p>

<p>Owing to the manner in which the squirrel disperses his treasures,
we can not tell the amount of the store required by each
animal, but in Northern America we find one which gives the
needful information. This is the chipping squirrel, chipmunk,
so called from its cry. Its scientific name is <i>Tamias Lysteri</i>.</p>

<p>It is a little creature not larger than a two-thirds grown rat,
and is very conspicuous on account of the black and yellow
stripes which run along its back. Being a creature which
leads a subterranean life for the greatest part of its time, it
does not possess the bushy tail of the tree-inhabiting squirrels.</p>

<p>Its underground habitation is a most elaborate composition
of galleries and chambers, so that there is plenty of space for
storage. Audubon once dug up a nest inhabited by four chipping
squirrels, and found in it two pecks of acorns, a quart of
large nuts, rather more than two quarts of buckwheat, besides
about half a pint of grass seeds and ordinary wheat. Considering
that the animals would pass the greater portion of the
winter months in lethargy, and would only eat at long intervals,
the amount of food is really surprising.</p>

<p>In former days, when the red men were supreme and depended
solely on hunting for their food, many a tribe has been
saved from extermination for want of food in the winter time by
digging up the nests of the chipping squirrel, and eating the
inhabitants as well as their stores.</p>

<p>In the dormouse we have another instance of hibernation
brought into contact with man.</p>

<p>This pretty little creature, which is too familiar to need description,
possesses in a great degree the power of becoming
fat toward the end of autumn. The ancient Romans were well
aware of this fact, and had regular establishments called
“gliraria” for the express purpose of fattening dormice for the
table.</p>

<p>The dormouse makes a singularly comfortable nest for itself.
It is nearly spherical and is composed externally of grass
blades woven together in a very ingenious manner. The animal
only leaves a small aperture, concealed by grass blades
which can be pulled asunder when the inmate enters or leaves
the nest, and which resume their position like the folds of a
drawn curtain. I once had a remarkably fine specimen of a
dormouse nest which was cut out of a hedge. The curtain of
grass blades was so admirably formed that it could seldom be
detected by any one who did not know the specimen.</p>

<p>Around, but not in this nest, the dormouse places its store of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
winter food, which is much of the same nature as that of the
squirrel, and mostly consists of nuts. For this reason the Germans
call the creature by the appropriate name of hazelmaus.</p>

<p>It was made in the fork of a hazel-branch, and was about
four feet from the ground, so that the small branches served to
strengthen as well as conceal it. The nest was exactly six
inches long by three in width, and was made almost entirely
of several kinds of grass, the broad-bladed sword-grass being
the chief material. Interwoven with the grass-blades were
sundry leaves, all hazel and maple, and none of them having
been taken from the branch on which the nest was built. It is
therefore possible that a dormouse may have placed the nest in
Mr. Waterton’s mill-stone. I do not, however, think it probable,
because there was no bush near the stone, and, as far as is
known, the dormouse always stores its food close to its nest.
The squirrel, however, ranges farther afield, and may often be
seen in the winter-time digging through the snow, at some distance
from its tree, so as to disinter the hidden food.</p>

<p>Another vegetable-eating hibernating rodent is the too well-known
hamster (<i>Cricetus frumentarius</i>) of Northern Europe.</p>

<p>It is about a foot in length, but, on account of its numbers,
is a most formidable enemy to the agriculturist. Even when
seeking its daily food it is terribly destructive to the crops, but
its worst raids are made at the end of the autumn, when it provides
a store for the winter. For this purpose it excavates a
deep and complicated system of burrows, in which it stores a
quantity of grain so enormous that after the harvest the farmers
are in the habit of digging up the hamster’s burrows and securing
their stolen property.</p>

<p>A single hamster carried off sixty pounds of wheat for its
winter store, while another had thought that a hundred weight
of beans were necessary for its subsistence. The animal wakes
very early from its hibernation, sometimes even in February.
It does not, however, come out of its burrow at once, but remains
beneath the earth until the warm weather has fairly set in.</p>

<p>Now we come to the bears.</p>

<p>I need not say that intertropical bears do not require to hibernate.
Moreover of those bears which inhabit the colder
climates the adult males seldom, if ever, hibernate, while the
young of both sexes are very uncertain in this respect. For
example, with the grizzly bear the young males and females
are found at large throughout the whole of winter, and the
same is the case with the polar bear. With the brown bear of
Northern Europe and the black bear of North America the
young animals seem to be rather capricious in hibernating.</p>

<p>In all cases, however, when the adult female bear is about to
add to the family she prepares for hibernating. With the exception
of the polar bear, who is obliged to form a most remarkable
habitation, the female chooses a safe retreat long
before it is required, and gradually conveys into it a large
quantity of leaves, moss, and small branches, so as to make a
comfortable bed.</p>

<p>Shortly before hibernating she becomes enormously fat, and
the new fur which she puts on is quite half as long again as
that of the summer raiment. Hunters, therefore, are naturally
anxious to kill the bear just before hibernating.</p>

<p>In the first place, a fully developed winter fur, taken before
it has been injured by use, will sell for twice as much money
as the fur of the same animal when taken in summer or after
hibernating. In the next place, the fat, which is so well-known
as “bear’s-grease,” always commands a ready sale.
Lastly, as bear’s meat, prepared either by freezing or smoking,
forms the greatest part of winter food in many a family, it is a
matter of the greatest consequence to have that meat in the
best condition.</p>

<p>How valuable it is under such circumstances may be realized
by reading the life of the old American hunter, Daniel Boone,
and seeing how, when his wife and children were nearly dying
of hunger and cold, he forced his way across the half-frozen
river, succeeded in killing a bear, and by almost superhuman
exertions transported all the meat across the river to his hut.</p>

<p>Supposing that the bear is not interrupted in her work, she
retires to the den just before winter, and closes the entrance as
well as she can.</p>

<p>In this place of refuge the young are born. They are at first
scarcely larger than rats, but increase in size, drawing the
whole of their nourishment from their mother, who takes no
food during the whole of the winter and early spring. In consequence,
when she and her young emerge, the latter are fat
and strong, while the mother is but the shadow of her former
self. Here again is a wonderful example of the many ways in
which God “giveth meat to all flesh.”</p>

<p>When a male or young female hibernates it comes out of its
refuge as fat as it was on entering it. The hibernation is so
perfect that there is scarcely any waste of tissue, as is the case
with the mother bear, whose young practically subsist on the
store of fat which she laid up in the autumn.</p>

<p>The polar bear when about to become a mother is obliged to
find a very different kind of refuge, as there are neither caves,
hollow trees, or branches, and often there is nothing but ice as
a resting-place and snow as a covering. So she depends for
shelter upon the snow. After selecting a convenient snow-drift,
she scrapes a hole in it, and suffers the snow to fall upon
her as it will.</p>

<p>In that country, where even the human inhabitants are
obliged to make their houses out of snow or perish, she is soon
buried under many feet of snow. Her thick fur keeps the snow
from contact with the skin, while the heat of her body gradually
melts the snow away from around her, so that she lies in a
sort of tent.</p>

<p>Now comes the question, ventilation. Were she alone all
the time she would need no communication with the external
air, as the hibernation would be perfect, and respiration would
not be required. But her young, who do not hibernate, must
breathe continually from the time of their birth, and she, being
disturbed by them, is forced to breathe occasionally.</p>

<p>Now, it is found that when animals are buried under snow
their warm breath continually ascends, and makes a passage
into the air. The aperture is a very small one, but quite sufficient
for the purpose; and even in our Scotch Highlands sheep
are enabled to breathe in a similar manner when buried in the
terrible snow-drifts, which are apt to overwhelm whole flocks at
a time.—<i>London Sunday Magazine.</i></p>

<p>Failure in any enterprise often rouses to fresh effort. You
fall in order to rise again. You are thrown down that you may
rise higher. Failure may thus carry in its bosom a rich harvest
of good. In men of spirit, who are not easily cowed, it acts
as a spur to exertion. Every time such a man is thrown down,
and, like the fabled Titan, touches mother earth, he rises again
with renewed strength. Many a great orator has failed ignominiously
in his first attempt; but if he has the right stuff in
him he is not disheartened. Like the late Lord Beaconsfield,
he says indignantly: “The time will come when you will hear
me!” He says it, and he keeps his word. We have a similar
instance in M. Thiers, the French historian and statesman.
When as a young man he made his <i>debut</i> in the Chamber of
Deputies, his speech was not a success. He felt that he had
failed. On returning home he said to his friends, “I have been
beaten; but never mind, I am not cast down, I am making my
first essay in arms. Beaten to-day, beaten to-morrow; it is the
fate of the soldier and the orator. In the tribune, as under fire,
defeat is as useful as a victory. We begin again!” Such
was the spirit of the man, such his indomitable resolution; and
we all know that his efforts were at last crowned with complete
success.</p>

<p>Failure, disappointment, and difficulties to be surmounted,
doubtless contribute an element of strength to the character.
We thus learn to persevere in a difficult task. Speaking of the
failures, delays, and obstacles met with at the siege of Troy,
Shakspere puts these words into the mouth of Agamemnon—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Which are, indeed, naught else</div>
<div class="verse">But the protractive trials of the great Jove,</div>
<div class="verse">To find persistive constancy in man.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Trials, misfortunes and difficulties of every kind, if properly
met, are a means of discipline. In the struggle with them we
are made stronger. They brace the mind, and give it firmness.
A disposition naturally gentle requires this tonic to prepare
it for the rougher duties of life. Many can say that the
disappointments and trials they have met with have given a
firmness to their temper which was much needed, and have
been of the greatest service to them.</p>

<p>I have never known any one who had difficulties to contend
with in his youth, and who wrestled with them successfully,
who was not thankful for them later in life. They felt that these
difficulties, resisted and overcome, helped to mould their character
and make them stronger and better men than they would
otherwise have been.</p>

<p>We read in the letters of Thomas Erskine, of Linlathen, as
follows: “A friend of mine once repeated to me a sentence
which he thought utter nonsense, but to me it seemed to have
a meaning. <i>What were rocks made for, my brethren? Even
that mariners might avoid them.</i> There was a gain in having
avoided rocks, which there would not be if rocks had never existed.”</p>

<p>In the same manner we may say, What was evil made for?
Even that we may avoid it. There is a gain in having avoided
and resisted evil, which there would not be if evil had never
existed.</p>

<p>The trials and troubles of life afford an education to which
no other is equal. We have not the finest type of character
in the monk and the nun, who lead a life of seclusion far away
from the evil of the world. Their virtues are only negative.
It is not among those who are shut up within stone walls and
jealously guarded, that you obtain the noblest type of character.
On the contrary, it is among those who have had to struggle
with evil in all its forms in the strife and conflict of life.
In this way virtue is strengthened, and a character formed nobler
than a life of mere innocence could impart.</p>

<p>It is seen that in those places where there is the greatest
amount of vice, there are also to be found many examples of
the greatest virtue. It is said that nowhere are there such good
people as in London, and the reason assigned is that nowhere
are there so many bad people. The Londoner lives in the
midst of temptations which have to be avoided and resisted—thus
the habit of virtue and of self-control is formed. Those
who are good, in spite of manifold temptations to evil, are likely
to be very good. Their virtue will be of a more robust type
than that of those who are immured in nunneries, and who are
kept innocent by temptation being removed out of their way.</p>

<p>There are two ways of dealing with mankind. You may remove
them from every temptation, and thus keep them innocent
in outward act. Or you may place them in the midst of
temptations, trusting to their power of resisting them. You
wish, for example, to guard a man from the habit of drunkenness.
You shut him up within stone walls, where the very
smell of drink is unknown; or you place him in a lonely
island, where there is no beverage to be had stronger than pure
water.</p>

<p>In this way you get rid of the temptation, but you sacrifice
the man. You make of him a nonentity. Others, not less
wise, would pursue a different course. They would leave him
a free agent in the world, with all its trials and temptations.
The probability is he would defend himself from the danger;
for, after all, even in the most drink-loving nations, it is only a
small proportion of the population that give way to this vice.
This latter method has the advantage, instead of sacrificing the
man, of improving him. It contributes an element of strength
to his character, and trains him to be a brave soldier in the battle
of life.</p>

<p>There is much in this avoidance of evil and keeping it in
check. It is the great means available for the development of
our moral nature. What exercise is to the body, resistance to
evil is to the mind.</p>

<p>The recreations of the better class of Paris workmen wear a
character of Arcadian simplicity.</p>

<p>On fêtes, and especially during that of the Republic, which,
though nominally confined to the fourteenth of July, continues
for several Sundays afterward, there is much dancing and all
the ordinary amusements of a fair.</p>

<p>The first day of the week, is, however, only a holiday once a
month, for the majority of workmen. On the afternoon of pay-Sunday
the workman takes his family outside the barrier for a
walk into the country. They have a simple dinner at one of
the numerous restaurants in the neighborhood, and wander in
the woods, plucking the wild flowers, or find a quiet nook,
where one of the party reads aloud. These happy afternoons
fill the workman’s heart with joy, and he begins to recall his
childhood and to talk of his old home in some distant province.
He takes his wine, is joyously excited, but nothing more;
the whole family return by train or tram-car, laden with lilac
or wild flowers, and are safe in bed by eleven o’clock.</p>

<p>Saturday evening is the favorite time for the theater. The
workman prefers the drama, and if the scene is pathetic, is
easily moved to tears.</p>

<p>On Sunday afternoon a few visit the Louvre, the Luxembourg,
and the Salon, and other picture galleries when open. They
are observed to fix their attention mostly on historical scenes,
or pictures which touch the feelings; a scene from the Inquisition,
a mother weeping over her children, or an inundation, or
a famine.</p>

<p>Compared with the German, the Paris workman can hardly
be said to possess any musical faculty whatever. The loud and
harsh noises to be heard night and day in Paris indicate that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the popular ear must be in an almost infantine condition.
Cracking their whips with the utmost violence is the ceaseless
delight of Parisian drivers, and during the fête and for many days
after, the urchins on the street render life unsupportable by constant
detonations of gunpowder.</p>

<p>To judge from the way the workmen gather round bookstalls,
and the avidity with which the young among them may be seen
devouring a book while waiting for the tram, reading must be a
real enjoyment to the more intelligent. I have seen a young
fellow in a blouse reading a book as he sat astride on the back
of a heavy cart-horse. A friend, a lady who has made friends
with a family at Belleville, finds them not only to possess a
good library, but to be well acquainted with French literature.
When a workman is a reader his taste will be good. He will
despise novels, especially of the vicious order; his favorite
books are histories of the Revolution, such as Lamartine’s
“Girondins;” Louis Blanc’s “Dix Ans;” “Histoire de Deux-Décembre,”
etc.; and for classics, Voltaire, Rousseau, and perhaps
Corneille.</p>

<p>If in the present adult population many may be found with
literary and artistic tastes, the workmen of the next generation
will be educated men, in the vulgar sense of the word; for it
would be difficult to give adequate expression to the fury with
which the instruction of the people is pressed forward. All
classes combine; the Republicans because they sincerely believe
that popular instruction is the great panacea for all the
ills of the world; Conservatives, because they hope that it will
make the people reasonable; Catholics, because they fear to
lose even those who still hold to the church.</p>

<p>Primary instruction is now compulsory and gratuitous. The
choice of the school rests with the father or guardian, but he
can not neglect to have his child instructed by some one and
somewhere. The communal schools are excellent, and the
greatest pains taken with the instruction. For the present generation
there are multitudes of lecture courses, popular and
gratuitous. I have no means of exactly knowing the number,
but it is said that there are now in Paris during the season as
many as 2,000 courses of lectures of one kind or another. A
very great number of these are open to the public.</p>

<p>In a speech made last December at the West London School
of Art, Mr. Mundella, M.P., stated that he had recently been
in France for the purpose of inquiring into the new system of
education, which came into operation on the 1st of October
last year, and that while there he had spent some time in trying
to ascertain the progress the French were making in giving
instruction in art. The Vice-President of the Council declared
himself “perfectly astounded by the facts that had come to his
knowledge on the subject. He had seen in Paris placards, six
feet long, offering gratuitous instruction to every person employed
in certain trades who would come and accept it. He
found schools of art, which were attended by hundreds and
thousands of students, in every part of the country. These
schools were supported, not only by government aid, but by the
different municipalities out of the local rates and taxes. Thus
all the artisans of Paris, and a large number of those in the
country, were receiving gratuitous art instruction. The Paris
municipality expended £32,000 in this way last year, and that
sum will be largely exceeded during the present year. He had
brought with him the ‘Paris Budget for Education’ for next
year (1883), and he found from it that that city with its population
of 1,900,000 would spend on education double the amount
that was expended for the education of the four millions who
lived in London.”</p>

<p>Why then may we not hope to see many Garfields in the
French Republic? The first great difficulty is the strong feeling
of caste which exists as powerfully in the workman as in
any other class.</p>

<p>M. Poulot has related an amusing instance of the way a young
lady of the middle class and her mother turned away from him
with a kind of horror when they learnt that he actually <i>worked</i>
in a factory, and helped to make the steam engines. But I
have met with an instance quite as startling on the other side.
Meeting at the house of a mutual friend, an orator, who, a few
days before, I had heard deliver a strong philippic against the
government, at a meeting mainly composed of workmen, and on
a question of interest to them, I asked him to introduce me to
one of his friends. He assured me that he only knew them in
the meetings, but that he did not know the address of any.
Nothing could give a stronger impression of the immense
chasm between the working class and those not actually members
of it, than to find one of their prominent advocates—a man
who, I believe, has been devoted for years to their cause—without
a single private friend among working-men.—<i>Good Words.</i></p>

<h2 id="A_RUSSIAN_NOVELIST">A RUSSIAN NOVELIST.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By GABRIEL MONOD.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>France has just lost an author who, though he never wrote in
French, had made France his adopted country, and had been
adopted by her as one of her most illustrious novelists—Ivan
Tourgénief. From the time when the petty persecution of the
Russian government obliged him to leave his native land, he
settled in France with his friends the Viardots, paying only
short occasional visits to Russia. It was at Bougival, near
Paris, that he died on the third of September, of a painful disease
from which he had been suffering for more than two years.
His works were often translated into French from the manuscript
itself, and appeared simultaneously in French and in
Russian; and though he depicted Russian types and manners
exclusively, his reputation was as great in Paris as at St. Petersburg,
and he passed with the general public for a great French
writer. He has contributed, more than any one else, to make
Russia understood in France, and to create a sympathy between
the two nations. Contemporary Russia lives complete in his
works. In his “Memoirs of a Russian Nobleman,” or “Recollections
of a Sportsman,” he has given expression to the sufferings,
the melancholy, the poetry, of the Russian country-folk,
and prepared the way for the emancipation of the peasants; in
“A Nest of Nobles” he has depicted the monotonous life of the
lesser gentry, living on their small fortunes in the heart of Russia;
in “Dimitri Roudine,” in “Smoke,” and in “The Vernal
Waters,” we find those Russian types which are met with all
over Europe—those nomads whose incoherent brains are seething
with all sorts of ideas, social, political, and philosophical;
those spirits in search of an ideal and a career, whom the narrow
and suffocating social life of Russia has turned into idlers
and weaklings; those worldlings, with their eccentric or vulgar
frivolity; those women, amongst whom we may find all that is
most cruel in coquetry and most sublime in self-devotion. Last
of all, in “Fathers and Sons,” he has revealed, with a prophetic
touch, the first symptoms of that moral malady of Nihilism
which is eating at the heart of modern Russia, and in
“Virgin Soil” he has given us a faithful and impartial description
of the society created by the Nihilistic spirit. Tourgénief
is a realist; his personages are real, his pictures are drawn from
life, his works are full of true facts; but he is at the same time
a true artist, not only in virtue of the power with which he reproduces
what he has seen, but because he has the faculty of
raising his personages to the dignity of human types of lasting
truth and universal significance, and because he describes, not
all he sees, but only what strikes the imagination and moves
the heart. He is wholesomely objective; he does not describe
his heroes, he makes them act and speak; the reader sees and
hears and knows them as if they were living people—loves
them and is sorry for them—hates and despises them. Tourgénief
is one of those novelists who have created the greatest
number of living types; he is one of those in whom we find the
largest, the most sensitive, the most human heart. He has
shown, like Dickens, all that warmth of heart can add to genius.—<i>The
Contemporary Review.</i></p>

<h2 id="BLUE_LAWS">BLUE LAWS.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>An interesting and suggestive chapter in our early colonial
history is found in the constitution, laws and court records of
Connecticut. That some of the enactments and judicial proceedings,
to those ignorant of the peculiar condition of the colonists,
seem ludicrous, and fit to provoke the unfriendly
criticism they have received, is not denied. But an honest,
competent critic can not take them thus, and will not hastily
discredit the intelligence of the men who, under new and most
trying circumstances, made such regulations for their little
commonwealth as the exigencies of the situation seemed to demand.
We do not approve of all the laws of that olden-time
as wise and just; nor do we think the administration always
beyond just reproach; but we do venerate the men who for the
glory of God and the good of society enacted and rigorously
enforced them.</p>

<p>The ancient orthography is retained as a specimen of the
English of that day:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">CONSTITUTION OF 1638.</p>

<p>“For as much as it hath pleased the Almighty God, by the wise disposition
of his divine providence, so to order and dispose of things, that
we, the inhabitants, and residents of Windsor, Hartford and Weathersfield,
are now dwelling in and uppon the river of Conneticut, and the
lands thereunto adjoining; and well knowing, when a people are gathered
together, the word of God requires, that, to the maintienence of the
peace and union of such a people there should bee an orderly and decent
government established, according to God, to order and dispose of
the affaires of the people at all seasons, as occasions shall require; doe
therefore associate and conjoine ourselves to bee as one publique State or
Commonwealth; and doe for ourselves and our successors, and such as
shall be adjoined to us at any time hereafter, enter into combination, and
confederation together, to meinteine and preserve libberty, and the purity
of the gospell of our Lord Jesus, which we now profess; as also the
discipline of the churches which, according to the truth of said gospell
is now practiced amongst us, as allso in all our civil affaires to be
guided, and governed according to such lawes, rules, orders and decrees,
as shall bee made, ordered, and decreed, as followeth.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then follows the constitution in eleven well considered sections,
making provision for the three departments—legislative,
judicial and executive. We freely confess our admiration of
this wonderful document, but can not, for want of room, print
it. This is the less necessary as it evidently formed the basis
of the charter of 1662, and its leading provisions have been
copied, with some modifications, into the constitutions of the several
States, and of the United States. As the first written constitution
formed for and adopted by a free people, for their own
government, it is a marvel of excellence. Written without a
model, it asserts for its authors a more comprehensive and
thorough statesmanship than is usually attributed to the leaders
in colonial politics at that early day.</p>

<p>The most peculiar feature of their civil polity was that only
the righteous were to be in authority, and all power was vested
in members of the church; and the conservative influence of
religion variously confessed. The church and state were separate,
yet, not inconsistently, we find an article headed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">“MAINTENANCE OF MINISTRY.”</p>

<p>“Whereas, the most considerable persons in the land came to these
parts of America, that they might enjoye Christe, in his ordinances without
disturbance; and whereas, amongst many other precious meanes, the
ordinances have beene and are dispensed amongst us with much purity
and power, they took it into their serious consideration that a due maintenance
might bee provided, and settled, both for the present and the
future, for the encouragement of the minister’s worke therein; and doe
order that those who are taught in the Word, in the several plantations,
bee called together, that evry man voluntarily sett downe what hee is
willing to allow to that end and use; and if any man refuse to pay a
meete proportion, that then hee bee rated by authority, in some just and
equall way; and if after this any man withhold, or delay due payment,
the civil power bee exercised as in other just debts.”</p>

</div>

<p>The “Capitall Lawes” were severe, and the executive officers
a terror to evil-doers. The death penalty was denounced
against criminals convicted of either of fourteen different offenses.
The burglar for the third offense lost his life.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. “If any man after legall conviction shall have or worship any other
god but the Lord God, hee shall bee put to death.”—Deut. 13:6, 17:2.</p>

<p>2. “If any man or woman bee a witch, that is, hath or consulteth with
a familliar spiritt, they shall bee put to death.”—Exodus 22:18; Levit.
20:27.</p>

<p>3. “If any person shall blaspheme the name of God, the Father,
Sonne or Holy Ghost, with direct, express, presumptuous or high-handed
blasphemy, or shall curse, in like manner, hee shall bee put to
death.”</p>

<p>4. “If any man shall commit any willful murder—which is manslaughter
commited from hatred, malice or cruelty—not in a man’s just
and necessary defense, nor by mere casualty against his will, hee shall
bee put to death.”</p>

<p>8. “If any person committeth adultery with a married or espoused
wife, the adulterer and adulteress shall surely bee put to death.”</p>

<p>12. “If any man shall conspire or attempt any invasion, insurrection
or rebellion against the Commonwealth hee shall bee put to death.”</p>

</div>

<p>The laws were specially severe against the social evil, and
the homes of the colonists guarded not only against the crimes,
but against all dalliance with evil, and imprudent conduct that
might weaken the family bonds. The purity and bliss of the
home might not be endangered with impunity, and the wayward
were punished with wholesome severity. Here is a court record:
“Martha Malbon, for consenting to goe to the farms with
Will Harding at night, to a venison feast, and … for dalliance
with said Harding was whiped.” How it fared with Will
we are not told, but presume there was safety for him only in
exile, as there was no marked discrimination in favor of his
sex at that time. As connected with this case it is further
recorded that “Goodman Hunt and his wife for keeping the
councells of said William Harding, baking him a pastry and
plum cakes, and keeping company with him on the Lord’s
day, and she suffering Harding to kisse her, they being only
admited to sojourn in this plantation on their good behavior,
ordered to be sent out of this towne within one month after the
date hereof; yea, in a shorter time, if any miscarriage be found
in them.—December 3, 1651.” On another page I find it recorded
that “Will Harding <i>was</i> sentenced to be <i>severely</i> whipped,
fined £10, and presently to depart the plantation, and not
retourne under the penalty of severer punishment.”</p>

<h2 id="THE_LIFE_OF_A_PLANET">THE LIFE OF A PLANET.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By RICHARD PROCTOR.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The material life of a planet is beginning to be recognized as
being no less real than the life of a plant or of an animal. It
is a different kind of life; there is neither consciousness such as
we see in one of those forms of life, nor such systematic progress
as we recognize in plant-life. But it is life, all the same.
It has had a beginning, like all things which exist; and like
them all, it must have an end.</p>

<p>The lifetime of a world like our earth may be truly said to be a
lifetime of cooling. Beginning in the glowing vaporous condition
which we see in the sun and stars, an orb in space passes gradually
to the condition of a cool, non-luminous mass, and thence,
with progress depending chiefly on its size (slower for the large
masses and quicker for the small ones), it passes steadily onward
toward inertness and death. Regarding the state in
which we find the earth to be as the stage of a planet’s mid-life—viz.,
that in which the conditions are such that multitudinous
forms of life can exist upon its surface, we may call that stage
death in which these conditions have entirely disappeared.</p>

<p>Now, among the conditions necessary for the support of life
in general are some which are unfavorable to individual life.
Among these may be specially noted the action of those subterranean
forces by which the earth’s surface is continually modeled
and remodeled. It has been remarked with great justice,
by Sir John Herschel, that since the continents of the earth
were formed, forces have been at work which would long since
have sufficed to have destroyed every trace of land, and to have
left the surface of our globe one vast limitless ocean. But
against these forces counteracting forces have been at work,
constantly disturbing the earth’s crust, and, by keeping it irregular,
leaving room for ocean in the depressions, and leaving
the higher parts as continents and islands above the ocean’s surface.
If these disturbing forces ceased to work, the work of
disintegrating, wearing away, and washing off the land would go
on unresisted. In periods of time such as to us seem long, no
very great effect would be produced; but such periods as belong
to the past of our earth, even to that comparatively short part
of the past during which she has been the abode of life, would
suffice to produce effects utterly inconsistent with the existence
of life on land. Only by the action of her vulcanian energies
can the earth maintain her position as an abode of life. She
is, then, manifesting her fitness to support life in those very
throes by which, too often, many lives are lost. The upheavals
and downsinkings, the rushing of ocean in great waves over
islands and seaports, by which tens of thousands of human beings,
and still greater numbers of animals, lose their lives, are
part of the evidence which the earth gives that within her frame
there still remains enough of vitality for the support of life during
hundreds of thousands of years to come.</p>

<p>This vitality is not due, as seems commonly imagined, to the
earth’s internal heat. Rather the earth’s internal heat is due to
the vitality with which her frame is instinct. The earth’s vitality
is in reality due to the power of attraction which resides in
every particle of her mass—that wonderful force of gravitation,
omnipresent, infinite in extent, the property whose range
throughout all space should have taught long since what science
is teaching now (and has been foolishly blamed for teaching),
the equally infinite range of God’s laws in time also. By virtue
of the force of gravity pervading her whole frame, the crust of
the earth is continually undergoing changes, as the loss of heat
and consequent contraction, or chemical changes beneath the
surface, leave room for the movement inward of the rock-substances
of the crust, with crushing, grinding action, and the generation
of intense heat. If the earth’s energy of gravity were lost,
the internal fires would die out—not, indeed, quickly, but in a
period of time very short compared with that during which, maintained
as they constantly are by the effects of internal movements,
they will doubtless continue. They are, in a sense, the
cause of earthquakes, volcanoes, and so forth, because they prepare
the earth’s interior for the action of her energies of attraction.
But it is to these energies and the material which as
yet they have on which to work, that the earth’s vitality is due.
She will not, indeed, retain her vitality as long as she retains
her gravitating power. That power must have something to work
on. When the whole frame of the earth has been compressed
to a condition of the greatest density which her attractive energies
can produce, then terrestrial gravity will have nothing left
to work on within the earth, and the earth’s globe will be to all
intents and purposes dead. She will continue to exercise her
attractive force on bodies outside of her. She will rotate on her
axis, revolve around the sun, and reflect his rays of light and
heat. But she will have no more life of her own than has the
moon, which still discharges all those planetary functions.</p>

<p>But such disturbances as the recent earthquakes, while disastrous
in their effects to those living near the shaken regions,
assure us that as yet the earth is not near death. She is still
full of vitality. Thousands—nay, tens, hundreds of thousands
of years will still pass before even the beginning of the end is
seen, in the steady disintegration and removal of the land without
renovation or renewal by the action of subterranean forces.—<i>The
Contemporary Review.</i></p>

<h2 id="DISRAELIS_LONDON">DISRAELI’S LONDON.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>One of Disraeli’s favorite ideas was that London ought to be
made the most magnificent city in the world—a real <i>Kaiserstadt</i>,
or imperial town, a model to all other cities in the character
of its public buildings, the sanitary perfection and outer
picturesqueness of its private houses, the width of its streets,
etc. When Napoleon III. commenced the re-edification of Paris
he used to say: “Is it not pitiful that the emperor should be doing
by force what we could do so much better of our own free will,
if we had a proper pride, to say nothing of good sense in the
matter?” Once when he was staying at Knole, he launched out
into a parody of Macaulay’s idea of the New Zealander meditating
over the ruins of London Bridge. He imagined this personage
reconstructing in fancy a row of villas at Brixton:
“What picture he would make of it! he would naturally suppose
that knowing how to build, and having just awoken to a knowledge
of sanitation, we had built according to the best ideas in
our heads.” Then he took his New Zealander among the ruins of
the stately commercial palaces crowded in narrow lanes all
round the Bank, and the Exchange: “He would conclude that
there must after all have been some tyrannical laws which prevented
our merchants from combining their resources to make
their streets spacious and effective, for it would seem absurd
to him that intelligent men should, at a great cost, have built
palaces for themselves in holes and corners where nobody
could admire them properly, when by acting in concert, they
might at much less expense have set much finer palaces in noble
avenues, courts and squares.” Then Disraeli broke out
into an animated description of his regenerate London with
Wren’s four grand approaches to St. Paul’s, boulevards transecting
the metropolis in all directions; and the palace of
Whitehall rebuilt after Inigo Jones’s designs to make new government
offices. He would have covered the embankment
pedestals with statues of admirals set in colossal groups recalling
great naval achievements, and he thought Stepney
ought to have its cathedral of St. Peter, and containing
memorials to all the humble heroes, sailors or fishermen who
lost their lives performing acts of courage on the water. When
he had finished speaking somebody observed that his plan
would cost £200,000,000, and convert every ratepayer into a
porcupine. “We may have to pay £500,000,000 in the end for
doing things in the present way,” he answered; “and as to
the porcupine, he is manageable enough if you handle him in
the right way.”—<i>Temple Bar.</i></p>

<h2 id="TEMPERATURE">TEMPERATURE.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By J. MORTIMER-GRANVILLE.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Such expressions as a “cool head,” “hot-headed,” and
the like, commonly relate to temperament rather than temperature;
but it is essential to a full comprehension of the subject
before us that the <i>rationale</i> of animal heat should be stated, and
the laws that govern the phenomenon of temperature actual
and subjective, at least cursorily, explained.</p>

<p>Heat and the sensation of heat are two widely different
states. When, on a chilly day or after washing in cold water,
a man rubs his hands until a glow of heat seems to suffuse
them, there is a very slight rise of actual temperature caused
by the friction; the feeling is principally due to nerve-excitement,
produced mechanically by the rubbing. The blood
flows more freely into, and through, the parts excited immediately
afterward, as shown by the redness, but the first impression
of heat is mainly one of sensation. The feeling and the
fact are not even constantly related. A person may feel hot
when not only the surrounding temperature but that of his body
is low; or, he may feel cold when really overheated. These
perverted sensations are occasionally morbid—that is to say,
form part of a state of disease—or they may arise from individual
peculiarities which, perhaps, render perceptions of a particular
class especially acute. On the other hand, there are
conditions of the body, and special sensibilities, in which the
sense of heat is dulled, and even considerable elevations of
temperature are not perceived. It is easy to see how impossible
it must be to form a correct judgment of the actual state of
heat either around or within us by simple sensation.</p>

<p>Throughout the world, whether man be placed in tropical
heat or arctic cold, the temperature of his body must, to maintain
health, be preserved at the same point—about 98.4 to .6
degrees of Fahrenheit. A very small departure from this universal
mean standard constitutes or indicates disease. The
external heat is comparatively unimportant, or only of secondary
moment, in the economy of nature; we can not rely upon it
for the compensation of differences in the heat generated within
the body by the organism. Except for the production of a
temporary effect, such as to give time for the reëstablishment
of the normal temperature in a body chilled, as by submersion,
external heat is useless for vital purposes. The only way in
which it can act is by preventing the loss of more heat, and
giving a slight aid to recovery by warming the surface of the
body.</p>

<p>If when a person is cold he goes into a heated apartment, or
sits before a large fire, he receives with advantage just as much
heat as will bring the skin of his body up to the normal standard;
as soon as that point is reached, the organism will begin
to labor to get rid of the superfluous caloric, and by sweating
the heat must be kept from rising above the standard. All the
heat thrust upon the body above 98.6 degrees is waste and mischievous
except in so far as it may promote perspiration, which
probably helps to work off some of the useless and burdensome,
possibly morbid and poisonous, materials that oppress
the system. This is how Turkish baths, and “sweatings” generally,
do good, by exciting increased activity of the skin, and,
as it were, opening up new ways of egress for matters which, if
retained, might offend.</p>

<p>So far as the heat of the body is concerned, whether in
health or disease, every degree of external heat which is above
the complement to form 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit with the heat
of the body itself at the time, is useless and may do harm. It
follows that in fever the surrounding atmosphere should be kept
cool; in depressing disease, when the heat-producing powers
of the organism are small, the air around should be warm.
These are precisely the conclusions to which experience and
observations conduct us; and the facts now briefly stated explain
the reason why.</p>

<p>There is no warmth in clothes; the heat comes from the
body itself, generated within, or the surrounding atmosphere,
or from substances with which the body may be in contact. Of
course clothes, like any other materials, can be charged with
heat, and will take up as much thermic or heating property as
their specific capacity allows. It is this capability of receiving
heat which constitutes the first condition of warmth in the comparative
value of different materials of dress. The second condition
consists in the physical power of any fabric to hold the
heat with which the article has been charged. For example,
some materials will become warmer in a given time and retain
their heat longer than others under the same conditions of exposure,
first to heating and then to cooling influences. The
principle of clothing should be to protect the body from external
conditions which tend to abstract heat, when the surrounding
temperature is lower than that of the body; and to strike
heat into the organism, when the temperature of the outside air
and of the substances with which the skin may be brought into
contact is higher than that of the animal body itself.</p>

<p>Local temperature, that is, the heat in the several regions of
the body is determined by conditions which control the circulation
of the blood, and the function of nutrition or food appropriation.
If the circulation is free in a part, its temperature is
maintained; if, from any cause, the flow of blood is retarded,
the local heat will be reduced. Any one may put this to the
test by encasing the hands in somewhat tight gloves when the
weather is cold. The pressure prevents the free passage of the
blood through the vessels, and the temperature falls. There is
no warmth of any kind in the gloves; they act simply as non-conductors
of heat, and prevent the heat generated within the
body from passing off. For example—if a piece of lint or rag
be dipped in cold water and laid on the skin, and a sheet of
impervious or non-conducting material, such as india-rubber or
thick flannel, is wrapped closely round, the heat of the body
will raise the cold water to a temperature at which it will be
given off as steam the moment the covering is removed. When
the extremities are enclosed in thick or dense coverings, their
temperature will depend on the amount of heat generated
within them, and if the flow of blood through the vessels is arrested
or retarded, nothing is gained, but everything lost, by
the measures taken to protect them from the external cold.</p>

<p>This is a matter of the highest practical moment, and needs
to be thoroughly understood. The feet can not be kept warm
unless the blood circulates freely in the extremities, and that
will not be the case if the boot, shoes, or stockings are tight.
These last-named articles of clothing are practically the worst
offenders. A stocking encircling the foot and leg closely and
enveloping every part, with special pressure at the instep,
around the ankle, and above or below the knees, must inevitably
tend to oppose the circulation and so reduce the natural
heat. The arteries which bring the blood to the extremity are
set deeper than the veins that carry it back, and, as the latter
are provided with valves which open toward the heart, it is too
commonly supposed that the “support” afforded by the stocking
will favor the return of blood more than it can impede the
deeper supply-currents, and so help the circulation; but practically
we know this is not the fact, for a tight stocking ensures
a cold foot, and the chilliness of which many persons complain
is mainly caused by the practice of gartering, and wearing
stockings which constrict somewhere or everywhere.</p>

<p>There is a popular notion that if the feet are cold the head
must be hot, and by keeping the extremities warm with wraps
the “blood is drawn from the head,” and its temperature reduced.
Those who have on the one hand studied the phenomenon
of fever, and on the other noted the physical condition
of races and individuals who habitually leave the extremities
unclothed, will know that this theory of the distribution of
heat is only partially true. Heat depends on the due supply of
nutrient elements to the tissues. It is the expression or result
of the process of local feeding. If a part is active it will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
heated. When the feet are left bare the complex muscular apparatus
of the extremity, which in a stiff shoe scarcely works,
is called into vigorous action, the arch of the foot plays with
every step, and each toe performs its share in the act of progression.
This promotes growth and calls for nutrition, whereby
the heat is maintained; whereas if it be simply packed away
as a useless piece of organism, no amount of external heat
will warm it. Work is the cause and counterpart of heat
throughout the body.</p>

<p>The same principle applies to the head. No amount of external
cooling will reduce the temperature, no drawing away of
the blood by artificial expedients will permanently relieve the
sense or obviate the fact of heat if the organ within the cranium
is excessively or morbidly active. The brain is a peculiarly
delicate and complicated organ, requiring more prompt
and constant nutrition than any other part of the body, because
the constituent elements of its tissue change more rapidly than
those of any other in proportion to the amount of exercise.
Moreover, the brain is always acting during consciousness, and
even in sleep it is seldom wholly at rest, as we know from the
occurrence of dreams. The faculty of nutrition is highly developed
in the organ or it could not so continuously, and on the
whole healthily, discharge its functions, even when other parts
of the body, or the system as a whole, are suffering from disease.
When the head is heated there is nearly always a local
cause for it, and the remedy must be addressed to the seat of
the malady. The temporary expedient of “drawing away the
blood” by applying heat to the extremities is useful as far as it
goes, and may suffice to enable the organ to rid itself by the
contraction of its blood-vessels from a surplus charge of this
fluid, but in the absence of special causes the <i>reason</i> of the
“heat of head” is undue exercise or disturbance of nutrition in
the brain itself. Perhaps the seat of the over-work and consequent
heating may have been limited to a particular part of
the head; for example, the apparatus of sight, or hearing, as
when the head becomes heated by reading too long or in a
strong light. The point to understand is that when the head is
physically hot it is the seat of too much or disorderly nutrition,
and either the amount of brain or sense-power exercised must
be reduced or the mode of action changed, and the particular
part of the apparatus of perception or thought which has been
too severely taxed relieved.</p>

<p>The true condition of health is that in which the temperature
of the body as a whole and of its several parts is not disturbed
by surroundings either of heat or cold. The preservation
of a natural and healthy temperature is mainly to be secured
by the maintenance of a regular and well distributed
circulation of blood charged with the materials of nutrition.</p>

<p>The first condition of a free and continuous flow of blood is
a healthy heart, not hampered by irritants, mental or physical.
Sudden grief or fright produces cold by arresting the circulation,
and the flow may be permanently retarded by anxiety.
The mind has a wondrously direct influence on the heart and
blood-vessels—on the latter through the nerves, which increase
or reduce the calibre of the minute arteries, as in blushing or
blanching at a thought. Instead of loading the body with
clothes, the “chilly” should search out the physical cause of
their coldness. The blood must not only circulate freely; it
must be rich in nourishing materials, and not charged with poison.
An excess of any one element may destroy the value of
the whole. It is too much the habit of valetudinarians and unhealthy
people of all kinds, to charge the blood with substances
supposed to be “heating” or “cooling” as they think the
system requires them. This is a mistake. The body does not
need to be pampered with cordials, or refrigerated with cunningly
devised potions. If it be well nourished it will be
healthy.</p>

<h2 id="SKATING_AND_SKATERS">SKATING AND SKATERS.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By ROBERT MACGREGOR.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Though it appears to be impossible to fix on the time when
skating first took root in this country, there can be no doubt
that it was introduced to us from more northern climates, where
it originated more from the necessities of the inhabitants than as
a pastime. When snow covered their land, and ice bound up their
rivers, imperious necessity would soon suggest to the Scands or
the Germans some ready means of winter locomotion. This
first took the form of snow-shoes, with two long runners of wood,
like those still used by the inhabitants of the northerly parts of
Norway and Sweden in their journeys over the immense snowfields.</p>

<p>When used on ice, one runner would soon have been found
more convenient than the widely-separated two, and harder
materials used than wood; first bone was substituted; then it,
in turn, gave place to iron; and thus the present form of skate
was developed in the North at a period set down by Scandinavian
archæologists as about A. D. 200.</p>

<p>Frequent allusions occur in the old Northern poetry which
prove that proficiency in skating was one of the most highly esteemed
accomplishments of the Northern heroes. One of them,
named Kolson, boasts that he is master of nine accomplishments,
skating being one; while the hero Harold bitterly complains
that though he could fight, ride, swim, glide along the ice
on skates, dart the lance, and row, “yet a Russian maid disdains
me.”</p>

<div class="verse indent1">A Russian maid’s disdain.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Specimens of old bone skates are occasionally dug up in
fenny parts of the country. There are some in the British Museum,
in the Museum of the Scottish Antiquaries, and probably in
other collections. There seems to be good evidence that even
in London the primitive bone skate was not entirely superseded
by implements of steel until the latter part of last century.</p>

<p>Mr. Roach Smith, F.S.A., describing one found about 1839,
says that “it is formed of the bone of some animal, made
smooth on one side, with a hole at one extremity for a cord to
fasten it to the shoe. At the other end a hole is also drilled
horizontally to the depth of three inches, which might have received
a plug, with another cord to secure it more effectually.”</p>

<p>There is hardly a greater difference between these old bone
skates and the “acmés” and club skates of to-day, than there
is between the skating of the middle ages and the artistic and
graceful movements of good performers of to-day. Indeed,
skating as a fine art is entirely a thing of modern growth. So
little thought of was the exercise that up to the Restoration days
it appears to have been an amusement confined chiefly to the
lower classes, among whom it never reached any very high
pitch of art. “It was looked upon,” says a writer in the <i>Saturday
Review</i> in 1865, “much with the same view that the boys
on the Serpentine even now seem to adopt, as an accomplishment,
the acmé of which was reached when the performer could
succeed in running along quickly on his skates and finishing
off with a long and triumphant slide on two feet in a straight
line forward. A gentleman would probably then have no more
thought of trying to execute different figures on the ice than he
would at the present day of dancing in a drawing-room on the
tips of his toes.”</p>

<p>During all this time, when skating was struggling into notice
in Britain, in its birth-place it continued to be cultivated as the
one great winter amusement. In Holland, too, where it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
looked upon less as a pastime than a necessity, nothing has so
frequently struck travelers as the wonderful change the advent
of ice brings about on the bearing of the inhabitants. “Heavy,
massive, stiff creatures during the rest of the year,” says Pilati,
in his “Letters on Holland,” “become suddenly active, ready
and agile, as soon as the canals are frozen,” and they are able
to glide along the frozen surface with the speed and endurance
for which their skating has been so long renowned, though these
very qualities are bought at the expense of the elegance and
grace we nowadays look for in the accomplished skater. Thomson
thus graphically describes the enlivening effects of frost on
the Dutch:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Now in the Netherlands, and where the Rhine</div>
<div class="verse">Branched out in many a long canal, extends,</div>
<div class="verse">From every province swarming, void of care,</div>
<div class="verse">Batavia rushes forth; and as they sweep,</div>
<div class="verse">On sounding skates, a thousand different ways</div>
<div class="verse">In circling poise, swift as the winds along,</div>
<div class="verse">The then gay land is maddened all to joy.</div>
<div class="verse">Nor less the northern courts, wide o’er the snow,</div>
<div class="verse">Pour a new pomp. Eager on rapid sleds,</div>

<div class="verse">Flushed by the season, Scandinavia’s dames</div>
<div class="verse">Or Russia’s buxom daughters glow around.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Though the poet of the “Seasons” speaks of Russia here, it is
curious to note that skating is not a national amusement of the
Russians, but is entirely of foreign and quite recent introduction.
It is quite unknown in the interior, and no Russian—except
a few who have picked up the art in St. Petersburg—ever
thinks of availing himself of the many pieces of water annually
frozen hard in so cold a country.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is in Friesland that the skate is most especially a
necessary of life. What stilts are to the peasant of the Landes,
skates are to the Frisian. The watercourses of the summer are
his highways when winter sets in. “He goes to market on
skates; he goes to church on skates,” we are told; “he goes
love-making on skates.” Indeed, it may be doubted if this
province could be inhabited if the art of skating were unknown,
for without it the inhabitants would be confined to home for
several months of each year. Frisians of both sexes actually
skate more than they walk, says M. Depping; no sooner is an
infant able to stand upright than the irons are fastened on his
feet; his parents lead him on to the ice, and teach him how to
move along. At six years most of the young skaters have attained
great proficiency, but in Frisian opinion even the best
performers improve up to thirty.</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere in Holland, ice races are of frequent occurrence
during the winter. “The races on the ice,” says Pilati,
“are the carnivals of the Dutch: they are their fêtes, their
operas, their dissipations;” naturally, therefore, the people
manifest the greatest interest in them; skate long distances to
be present, and cherish the names of distinguished winners in
a way we should never expect from such an unemotional people
as the Hollanders appear when the ice is gone and when
most travelers see them.</p>

<p>The women have races of their own; but most interesting of
all the contests are those in which the sturdy dames, whom
their own painters delight in depicting as gliding along to market
with baskets on their heads and knitting-needles in their
busy fingers, are matched against the best of the other sex.
Though, as a rule, these “Atalantas of the North” excel the
men rather in beauty of style than in speed, yet the prize often
enough goes to one of them.</p>

<p>Frequently on the Continent skates have proved themselves
excellent engines of war, both in actual fighting—as when a
Dutch army on skates once repulsed a force of Frenchmen on
the Scheldt—and as a rapid means of communication. During
the winter of 1806, Napoleon, after the battle of Jena, wished to
send an order with the utmost dispatch, to Marshal Mortier,
directing him to make himself master, without delay, of the
Hanseatic towns. The officer charged with this order found
himself at the mouth of the Elbe at a point where it was seven
and a half miles from bank to bank. To cross in a boat was
impossible, as the river was coated with a surface of newly-frozen
ice; to get over by a bridge would necessitate a detour of
more than twenty miles. The officer, knowing how precious
time was, determined to skate over the thin ice; and though it
was too weak to bear a man walking, he skimmed along so
rapidly that he got across in safety, gaining great honor for the
ingenuity and boldness that enabled him to deliver his despatch
six hours sooner than he possibly could have done by the ordinary
route.</p>

<p>In Holland, regiments have regular parades on the ice; but
Norway is probably the only country where it has been considered
necessary to embody a special corps of skaters. In this
regiment, “the men are furnished,” says Mr. Russell, in his
translation of Guillaume Depping’s book, “with the skates
in ordinary use in the North, that fixed on the right foot being
somewhat longer than that on the left. Furnished with
these, the soldiers descend steep slopes with incredible rapidity,
re-ascend them as quickly, cross rivers and lakes, and halt
at the slightest signal, even while moving at the highest speed.”</p>

<p>Skating has had many enthusiastic votaries, but probably
none more so than the two illustrious names that continental
skaters are so proud to reckon in their guild.</p>

<p>Klopstock, even in his old age, was so ardent a lover of it
that, after skimming over the ice of Altona for hours, “to call
back that warmth of blood which age and inactivity had chilled,”
he retired to his study and wrote fiery lyrics in its praise. His
friend and great successor, Goethe, took to skating under peculiar
circumstances. He sought relief in violent exercise from
embittered memories of a broken-off love affair. He tried in
vain riding and long journeys on foot; at length he found relief
when he went to the ice and learned to skate, an exercise
of which he was devotedly fond to the last. “It is with good
reason,” he writes, “that Klopstock has praised this employment
of our physical powers which brings us in contact with the
happy activity of childhood, which urges youth to exert all its
suppleness and agility, and which tends to drive away the inertia
of age. We seem, when skating, to lose entirely any consciousness
of the most serious objects that claim our attention.
It was while abandoning myself to these aimless movements
that the most noble aspirations, which had too long lain dormant
within me, were reawakened; and I owe to these hours,
which seemed lost, the most rapid and successful development
of my poetical projects.”</p>

<p>That skating has been in certain circumstances something
more than mere elegant accomplishment, is well illustrated by
two anecdotes, told by the author of some entertaining “Reminiscences
of Quebec,” of two settlers in the far West, who saved
their lives by the aid of their skates. In one case the backwoodsman
had been captured by Indians, who intended soon after to
torture him to death. Among his baggage there happened to
be a pair of skates, and the Indians’ curiosity was so excited
that their captive was told to explain their use. He led his captors
to the edge of a wide lake, where the smooth ice stretched
away as far as the eye could see, and put on the skates. Exciting
the laughter of the Indians by tumbling about in a clumsy
manner, he gradually increased his distance from the shore, till
he at length contrived to get a hundred yards from them without
arousing their suspicion, when he skated away as fast as he
could, and finally escaped.</p>

<p>“The other settler is said to have been skating alone one
moonlight night, and, while contemplating the reflection of the
firmament in the clear ice, and the vast dark mass of forest surrounding
the lake and stretching away in the background, he
suddenly discovered, to his horror, that the adjacent bank was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
lined with a pack of wolves. He at once ‘made tracks’ for
home, followed by these animals; but the skater kept ahead,
and one by one the pack tailed off; two or three of the foremost,
however, kept up the chase, but when they attempted to
close with the skater, by adroitly turning aside, he allowed them
to pass him. And after a few unsuccessful and vicious attempts
on the part of the wolves, he succeeded in reaching his log hut
in safety.”</p>

<h2 id="BOOK_KNOWLEDGE_AND_MANNERS">BOOK KNOWLEDGE AND MANNERS.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By LORD CHESTERFIELD.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>I have this evening been tired, jaded, nay, tormented, by the
company of a most worthy, sensible and learned man, a near
relation of mine, who dined and passed the evening with me.
This seems a paradox, but is a plain truth, he has no knowledge
of the world, no manners, no address; far from talking
without book, as is commonly said of people who talk sillily, he
only talks by book; which in general conversation is ten times
worse. He has formed in his own closet, from books, certain
systems of everything, argues tenaciously upon those principles,
and is both surprised and angry at whatever deviates from
them. His theories are good, but, unfortunately, are all impracticable.
Why? because he has only read, and not conversed.
He is acquainted with books, and an absolute stranger
to men. Laboring with his matter, he is delivered of it with
pangs; he hesitates, stops in his utterance, and always expresses
himself inelegantly. His actions are all ungraceful;
so that, with all his merit and knowledge, I would rather converse
six hours with the most frivolous tittle-tattle woman, who
knew something of the world, than with him. The preposterous
notions of a systematical man, who does not know the
world, tire the patience of a man who does. It would be endless
to correct his mistakes, nor would he take it kindly; for
he has considered everything deliberately, and is very sure
that he is in the right. Impropriety is a characteristic, and a
never-failing one, of these people. Regardless, because ignorant,
of customs and manners, they violate them every moment.
They often shock, though they never mean to offend; never
attending either to the general character, nor the particular distinguishing
circumstances of the people to whom, or before
whom they talk; whereas the knowledge of the world teaches
one, that the very same things which are exceedingly right and
proper in one company, time and place, are exceedingly absurd
in others. In short, a man who has great knowledge, from experience
and observation, of the characters, customs, and
manners of mankind, is a being as different from, and as superior
to, a man of mere book and systematical knowledge, as
a well-managed horse is to an ass. Study, therefore, cultivate
and frequent, men and women; not only in their outward, and
consequently guarded, but in their interior, domestic, and consequently
less disguised, characters and manners. Take your
notions of things as by observation and experience you find
they really are, and not as you read that they are or should be;
for they never are quite what they should be.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 252px;">
<img src="images/decoline1_arrowsbox.jpg" width="252" height="14" alt="decorative line" />
</div>

<p>A man of the best parts, and the greatest learning, if he does
not know the world by his own experience and observation,
will be very absurd; and consequently very unwelcome in
company. He may say very good things; but they will probably
be so ill-timed, misplaced, or improperly addressed, that he
had much better hold his tongue. Full of his own matter and
uninformed of, or inattentive to, the particular circumstances
and situations of the company, he vents it indiscriminately; he
puts some people out of countenance; he shocks others; and
frightens all, who dread what may come out next. The most
general rule that I can give you for the world, and which your
experience will convince you of the truth of is, never to give
the tone to the company, but to take it from them; and labor
more to put them in conceit with themselves, than to make them
admire you. Those whom you can make like themselves better,
will, I promise you, like you very well.</p>

<p>A system-monger, who, without knowing any thing of the
world by experience, has formed a system of it in his dusty cell,
lays it down, for example, that (from the general nature of
mankind) flattery is pleasing. He will therefore flatter. But
how? Why, indiscriminately. And instead of repairing and
heightening the piece judiciously, with soft colors and a delicate
pencil; with a coarse brush, and a great deal of white-wash,
he daubs and besmears the piece he means to adorn.
His flattery offends even his patron; and is almost too gross
for his mistress. A man of the world knows the force of flattery
as well as he does; but then he knows how, when, and
where to give it; he proportions his dose to the constitution of
the patient. He flatters by application, by inference, by comparison,
by hint; and seldom directly. In the course of the
world there is the same difference, in everything, between
system and practice.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>One hundred years have passed away since Richard the
Lion-hearted, Ivanhoe and Robin Hood met at the “Joyous
passage of arms at Ashby.” Our next story, “Castle Dangerous,”
opens upon days even more bitter and warlike; Scotland
is rent with bitter feuds. The daughter of King Alexander the
Third died in 1291, and no fewer than twelve persons claimed
the throne. King Edward of England was chosen arbiter. He
took advantage of sectional discord and endeavored to make
Scotland subject to the English crown. He found a willing instrument
in the person of John Baliol, who basely acknowledged
himself vassal and subject. King Edward further demanded
the surrender of three powerful castles, Berwick, Roxburgh
and Jedburgh; but the people murmured and Baliol was
compelled to do battle with Edward. Under this weak and
treacherous leader the Scottish army was defeated in a great
battle near Dunbar in 1296. Edward marched through Scotland
at the head of a powerful army. He removed to London
the records of the Scottish Kingdom, carried the great stone of
Scone, upon which the Scottish Kings had been crowned for
centuries, to Westminster Abbey, and placed the government
of Scotland in the hands of John de Warrene, Earl of Surrey.</p>

<p>At this juncture a leader arose in the person of Sir William
Wallace, the son of a private gentleman, and in no way related
to the nobility of the kingdom. His glorious struggle kept
alive the spark of Scottish liberty. He gathered to himself a
band of brave men, and defeated the English army near Stirling.
The Scottish people, as they had no king, chose him
Protector, and he was titled Sir William Wallace, Governor of
the Scottish Nation. He was defeated, captured by a traitor,
brought to trial in the great hall of William Rufus in Westminster,
sentenced to death as an outlaw, his body divided into
four quarters and placed on London bridge.</p>

<p>Among the followers of William Wallace were two powerful
barons, Robert Bruce and John Comyn, whose claims were
about equal, by descent, to the Scottish throne. They met before
the high altar in the Church of Dumfries. What passed
betwixt them is not known; but they quarrelled and Bruce slew
him with his dagger. Scott puts a defence of this high-handed
deed in the mouth of Robert Bruce which we will quote later.
Having committed an act which would bring down upon his
head the fierce anathema of the Romish Church, which would
moreover arouse the King of England and the powerful family
of Comyn, Bruce determined to put them all to defiance, and
was crowned King of Scotland at the Abbey of Scone the
29th of May, 1306. Among his devoted friends was James,
Lord of Douglas. His castle was on the border of Scotland,
and it is in the vicinity of this castle, known as Castle Dangerous,
that the scene of our romance is laid. So much for the
historical preface which may be of service to the reader in connection
with the incidents under our consideration.</p>

<p>In the old chronicles and poems of Scottish history, notably
that of Barbour, considerable space is devoted to the adventures
of Douglas. His castle was captured again and again by
the English; but the victors held it at such hazard against the
attacks of the adventurous Douglas, that it was considered a
perilous and uncertain piece of property. With a romantic enthusiasm,
in keeping with those chivalrous times, Lady Augusta,
a wealthy English heiress, distinguished for her beauty,
promised her hand and fortune to the knight, who would show
his courage by defending the castle against the Scots “for a
year and a day.” A brave knight, John de Walton, started up
and said “that for the love of that lady he was willing to keep
the Perilous Castle for a year and a day if the King pleased to
give him leave.” The King gladly gave his consent, being
well pleased to get so brave a knight for such an important
fortress.</p>

<p>There was an old prophecy of Thomas the Rhymer, that as
often as the Castle of Douglas should be destroyed it would
arise grander and stronger than ever from its ruins. The
prophecy had already been fulfilled and its great walls seemed
able to withstand the most powerful siege. Some manuscripts
of Thomas the Rhymer were also preserved in the Castle, and
our first chapter opens with a description of two travelers,
showily dressed in the fashion of the wandering minstrels of
the day, apparently father and son, making a pilgrimage to the
castle with the avowed purpose of finding some of the papers
or books of the old poet. They are lodged at the house of one
Thomas Dickson. They arouse the suspicion of two English
soldiers who are quartered at the Dickson farm-house. The
elder minstrel is conducted to the castle and imprisoned; the
younger is placed in a neighboring convent. By this time the
reader begins to suspect that the younger minstrel is no other
than the fair Lady Augusta, making a trip under disguise of a
minstrel-boy to see how her knight is prospering. Attended
by her father’s minstrel she reminds one of Rosalind in “As
You Like It,” under the guidance of the faithful Touchstone.
During her detention at the convent she confessed her secret
to Sister Ursula, and they escape by night through a trap-door
and subterraneous passage, although the convent is strongly
guarded. They separate, and by rather an unnatural process
again meet at the Douglas Kirk, where the services of Palm
Sunday are converted into a warlike controversy. A hand-to-hand
conflict, worthy of the Homeric heroes, is recorded between
Lord Douglas and De Walton. In the midst of the fray
a herald arrives, announcing the defeat of the English army,
and the first triumph of Robert Bruce. De Walton surrenders
to Douglas, who allows him without ransom to return to England
with the Lady Augusta, and unlike the seven years’ toil of
Jacob for Rachel, the daughter of Laban, which was lengthened
to fourteen years, the one year and a day was shortened,
no doubt to the great delight of the interested parties.</p>

<p>The most dramatic incident in the story is the midnight interview
between the English knight, De Valence, and the old
sexton in the ruined burial-place of the Douglas Kirk. The story
throughout is chivalrous and romantic; but “Castle Dangerous”
does not rank with other stories of the Waverley series in
power, incident or dramatic unity. I have already alluded to
“Count Robert of Paris” as the last of the Waverley Novels
written by the great magician, and it is so regarded, as “Castle
Dangerous” was never really completed by the author; but it
serves as a connecting link in the great chain, and, in spite of
its incompleteness, gives a graphic description of years eloquent
with prowess and manly courage.</p>

<p>There are five poems of Sir Walter which I deem worthy of
association with the Waverley Novels, viz: “The Lord of the
Isles,” “The Lay of the Last Minstrel,” “The Lady of the
Lake,” “Marmion,” and “Rokeby,” which I propose to consider,
each in its place.</p>

<p>“The Lord of the Isles” is associated with the same stirring
events as “Castle Dangerous,” and presents a faithful portrayal
of the adventures and history of Robert Bruce. It opens
at Ardtornish Castle whose ruins still rise bold and towering on
the coast of Morven. I saw it once in the gray gloamin’ of an
August evening, on my return from Staffa and Iona; and the
opening canto of the poem was impressed upon my mind at
that time, in lines never to be effaced. As I sat upon the
deck of the steamer I heard the minstrel song again echoing
among the crags—“Wake Maid of Lorn”—prelude to the wedding
festivities already arranged but destined to be long delayed.
I saw Lord Ronald’s fleet again sweep by</p>

<p>I saw the solitary skiff, bearing the hope and pride of Scotland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>

<p>I heard the Abbott’s stern charge asking the heroic King if
he knew reason aught, why his curse should not be pronounced
in requital of that rash deed at the high altar of the Church of
Dumfries. I heard the eloquent defense of the King, and the
unexpected and sublime blessing of the Abbott.</p>

<p>There is nothing, to my mind, in any poem more dramatic
than this unexpected prayer of the abbott; and the reader does
not wonder that</p>

<div class="verse i1">Was silence, awful, deep and long.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The scene of the poem now changes to the stormy island of
Skye, where Sir Walter pauses to give one of his beautiful descriptions
in the fourteenth and fifteenth divisions of canto third.</p>

<p>The fourth canto takes the king <i>en route</i> past the island of
Staffa, with its Fingal’s Cave, and Iona, with its sainted shrine—the
cradle of Christianity in Britain, now in ruin. His description
of Staffa is one of the most beautiful in English verse:</p>

<p>In canto fifth the king returns to Scotland. He rallies his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
adherents, and the sixth canto closes with a graphic description
of the battle of Bannockburn. The incidents are so stirring
that we almost forget the fate of fair Edith and her brave Roland,
but the last line of the poem assures us that they are at
last happily wedded.</p>

<p>“The Lord of the Isles” does not possess the pleasing qualities
of the “Lady of the Lake,” or the sustained vigor of “Marmion;”
but it is a noble poem throughout, and abounds with
passages revealing the deep reverence and exalted character of
the author. The reader will note the heart-spoken prayer and
God-speed of the priest as King Robert embarks upon his uncertain
mission:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“O heaven! when swords for freedom shine</div>
<div class="verse i1">And monarch’s right, the cause is thine!</div>
<div class="verse i1">Edge doubly every patriot blow!</div>
<div class="verse i1">Beat down the banners of the foe!</div>
<div class="verse i1">And be it to the nations known,</div>
<div class="verse i1">That victory is from God alone.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In connection with the “Lord of the Isles” and “Castle Dangerous,”
it is well to read carefully the sixth, seventh, eighth,
ninth and tenth chapters of Scott’s “Tales of a Grandfather.”
It is also pleasant to note that the friendship between Robert
Bruce and James Douglas was constant and unchanging; in
fact, their unwavering trust and fidelity are emphasized by the
dying wish of the king, who desired his heart to be carried to
Jerusalem after his death, and requested Douglas to take charge
of it. It was in fulfillment of a vow which he had been unable
to perform—to go to Palestine and fight for the Holy Sepulchre.
“Douglas wept bitterly as he accepted the office, the
last mark of the Bruce’s friendship and confidence. He caused
a case of silver to be made, into which he put the heart, and
wore it around his neck, by a string of silk and gold.” He set
off with a gallant train of the bravest men in Scotland. But the
doughty James found an opportunity in Spain for a skirmish
with the infidels, which he could not let pass; he was overpowered
by numbers, and, seeing no chance for escape, he took
from his neck the Bruce’s heart, and throwing it before him,
exclaimed, “Pass first in fight, as thou wert wont to do, and
Douglas will follow thee or die.” His body was found after the
battle lying upon the silver case, and the heart of the Scottish
king was returned to his native country, and interred beside
the high altar under the east window of Melrose Abbey.</p>

<h2 id="PLANT_NUTRITION">PLANT NUTRITION.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By MAXWELL T. MASTERS, M.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>A living plant feeds, breathes, grows, develops, multiplies,
decays, and ultimately dies. In so doing it receives, it spends,
it accumulates, it changes. Some of these processes are always
in operation, very generally more than one is going on at the
same time, and the action of one is modified by and controlled
by that of another. Some circumstances and conditions favor
these operations, others hinder them.</p>

<p>The nutritive process has to be entered on the creditor side
as a receipt. The plant will indeed feed upon itself for a time,
or rather it will feed upon what its predecessor left it as an inheritance
for this very purpose, or upon the stores accumulated
in the plant itself during the preceding season; thus, when a
seed, or rather the young plant within the seed, begins to grow,
it is at first unable to forage for itself, but it depends for its sustenance
on the materials laid up for its use during the preceding
season by the parent plant. So the bud of a tree awakening
into life, and beginning its career as a shoot which is to bear
leaves and flowers, derives its first meals from the reserves accumulated
the autumn previously in the parent branch. Very
generally a little water, supplied from without, is required before
the plant can avail itself of these stored-up provisions, but
this is not always indispensable. Potatoes begin to sprout in
their cellars or pits, as growers know to their cost, before they
can have obtained a drop of water from without. In this latter
case there is water enough already in the tuber to allow of food
being utilized.</p>

<p>A certain degree of useful heat is, of course, quite indispensable.
Practically, no plant will feed when its temperature is
reduced as low as the freezing point, and in most cases the heat
requires to be considerably greater. Each kind of plant, each
individual plant, and indeed each part of a plant, feeds, and
performs each item of its life-work best at a certain temperature,
and ceases to work at all when the temperature falls below
or rises above a certain point. The particular degree, whether
most or least favorable, varies according to the plant, its age,
stage of growth and various external circumstances, which we
need only mention, as their effects will be readily understood
without the necessity of explanation.</p>

<p>Leaving, however, on one side, the temperature, we have to
consider the water which is so essential, not only in the feeding
processes with which we are now concerned, but with every
other action of plant life. Fortunately there is, in general, no
lack of it; the earth and the air contain their shares of this
elementary compound in varying proportions and varying
modifications as liquid or gaseous. Besides, the plant itself
has so much of it that even at the driest condition compatible
with life, it still constitutes a very large proportion of the entire
weight. Now, it is as a rule when the plant, the seedling, or
the bud is at its driest that growth begins, the necessity for food
first manifests itself, and the demand for a further supply of
water becomes imperative. How is the demand supplied? We
have seen that there is no lack of that fluid. How is it to get
into the plant?</p>

<p>When one liquid, say spirit, is poured into another, say water,
the two gradually mix. If we suppose these liquids to
consist of a number of molecules, then, mixture may be taken
to be the result of the displacement say of one molecule of
water by one molecule of spirit, and so, throughout the whole
quantity of liquid, there is displacement and replacement till at
length equilibrium is restored and a thorough diffusion results.
This power of diffusion does not always exist. The molecules
of water and of oil will not mix or diffuse freely through each
other. Water containing carbonic acid gas will not mix, in
this sense of the term, with water containing acetate of lead.</p>

<p>It may be a truism to say, that for the process of diffusion the
liquids must be diffusible, but the fact must be carefully borne
in mind in all questions relating to the feeding of plants. In
the case of plants, the phenomenon of diffusion, or the gradual
admixture of two liquids of different natures, is complicated by
the presence of a membrane in the shape of the cell-wall. The
water from the outside has to pass through the membrane to
reach the protoplasm on the other side. Speaking broadly,
there are no holes in the membrane through which the water
can pass. Ingress is secured by that process of diffusion to
which reference has just been made, and by virtue of which
the molecules of the membrane and the molecules of the water
shift and change places; the space that was occupied by a molecule
of membrane is now occupied by a molecule of water, and
<i>vice versa</i>. The access, therefore, of water into the interior of
a closed cell is the result of the process of diffusion. Where
two liquids mix without any intervening membrane, the mixture
is called diffusion simply; where there is an intervening
membrane, the diffusion process is known as “osmosis.”</p>

<p>The raw material (the term is not quite accurate, but for illustration
sake it may pass) is that very marvelous substance
now called “protoplasm.” We must leave it to chemists and
microscopists to explain its composition and indicate its appearance.</p>

<p>Diffusion is not equal or alike in all cases; it depends upon
the extent to which the two liquids are diffusible, upon their
different densities, upon temperature, and a variety of other
conditions. So, in the case of osmosis, we have not only the
nature of the two fluids to consider, but their relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
membrane that separates them. The membrane may be much
more permeable to one of the two fluids than to the other.
Thus, in the case of a living cell, the membrane or wall is much
more permeable to water than it is to protoplasm; and so it
happens that, while water readily penetrates the membrane and
diffuses itself in the protoplasm, protoplasm does not nearly so
readily permeate the membrane as the water. Ingress of water
is easy and of constant occurrence, egress of protoplasm is rare
and exceptional.</p>

<p>Pure water or weak saline solutions, such as are generated in
the soil under certain circumstances, pass readily through
membrane—that is, the molecules of the one shift and change
places with those of the other—while those of gummy or albuminous
substances like protoplasm do not. After a time, if
there is no outlet for the water absorbed, or if it is not utilized
within the plant in some way, absorption and diffusion cease,
the cell becomes saturated with water, and until something
happens to disarrange the balance, no more is absorbed. But,
even in the case where the cell is saturated with water, it may
still take up other liquids, because the diffusive power of those
other liquids, in relation to the cell-wall and to the protoplasm,
is different from that of water, and this absorption may go on
in its way till saturation point is reached for each one of them,
just as in the case of water. On the other hand, it may happen
that the plant may be saturated with other substances, and incapable
of taking up more of them, while at the same time pure
water may be freely taken up.</p>

<p>Just so much and no more of each particular substance is absorbed,
the exact quantity of each being regulated in all cases
by the condition and requirements of the cells, their membranous
walls, and their contents. Thus it happens that some
particular substances may be found by the chemist to exist in
large relative proportions in the plant, while the quantity in
any given sample of the soil from which it must be derived is
sometimes so small as to elude detection. The plant in this
case, or some part of it, is so greedy, if we may so say, for this
particular substance, that it absorbs all within its reach, and
stores it up in its tissues or uses it in some way, the demand
ensuring supply. On the other hand, the soil may contain a
large quantity of some particular ingredient which is incapable
of being absorbed, or which the plant does not or can not make
use of, and, in consequence, none is found within the plant.
The supply is present, but there is no demand.</p>

<p>The different physical requirements of the plant supply also
the explanation of the fact that different plants, grown in the
same soil, supplied with the same food, yet vary so greatly in
chemical composition. Thus, when wheat and clover are
grown together, and afterwards analyzed, it is found that while
lime is abundant in the clover, it is relatively in small quantity
in the wheat; and silica, which is abundant in the wheat, is
absent from the clover. Poisonous substances even may be
absorbed, if they are of such a nature as to be capable of absorption;
and so the plant may be killed by its own action—by
suicide, as it were.</p>

<p>The entrance of water into the plant and the entrance of
those soluble materials which a plant derives from the soil are
therefore illustrations of the process of osmosis, and are subjected
to all the conditions under which osmosis becomes possible,
or under which it ceases to act.</p>

<p>One thing we must strive to impress forcibly on the reader,
because, if the notion is well grasped, it will enable him to understand
plant life so much more vividly. We allude to the
continual changes that are going on throughout the whole living
fabric of the plant while in its active condition. Cell membrane,
the protoplasm, the entire mass of liquid and solid constituents
of which the plant consists, are, as we have seen,
made up of molecules, each, as it were, with a life of its own,
undergoing continual changes according to different circumstances,
acting and reacting one upon another so long as any
active life remains.</p>

<p>One of our faithful members—a member of the class of ’84—on
the first day of October sent this pleasant greeting to the
Superintendent of Instruction: “My Dear Doctor—This is
opening day. I must send you a line just to keep it—and the
Lord keep you!”</p>

<p>The Sacramento Circle last year answered in writing over
1,000 questions, besides having prepared sixty-two original papers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young lady who has charge of a Young Ladies’ Seminary
in Washington, D. C., recently remarked that she had adopted
the Chautauqua Text-Books on History as an auxiliary in her
school, as they are so condensed and so carefully arranged. She
said that at the last examination of her graduating class the influence
of the little Text-Books was visible in the remarkable
proficiency of the pupils.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Each C. L. S. C. Local Circle in the study of Biology should
secure the services of a local microscopist, if possible. Without
the microscope, Biology is like Hamlet with Hamlet left
out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In one of the leading churches of one of the leading denominations
in one of the leading cities of the United States, a
strange thing has happened. The president of the local circle
of the C. L. S. C. made application for the privilege of holding
bi-monthly meetings in a room in the basement of the church,
so many of the members of the circle being members of the
church. The matter was referred to the president of the board,
a leading lawyer, who refused the application. When asked
why he should exclude such an auxiliary of the church, and especially
a circle containing so much of the religious element,
he responded that it “could not be a religious organization, because
they were studying biology.” This is very hard to believe
if it were not well vouched for. If the church had been a
Methodist Episcopal Church, the editor of this column would
have felt at liberty to make a few direct remarks; but, as it refers
to another very respectable and very orthodox branch
of the Holy Catholic Church, he must content himself with this
general announcement. What would this leading lawyer have
said to the wise man who said: “Go to the ant, thou sluggard,
consider her ways and be wise;” or to that wiser teacher who
commanded his disciples to “consider the lilies.” Biology
zoölogical and biology botanical being commended in the Bible,
and the study being necessary to the fullest interpretation of
the Bible, we commend our legal friend to a little more biblical
study.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Apropos to the above item is the following communication
from an earnest New England member: “At a certain Sunday-school
convention this question was given me to answer: ‘What
is the effect of the Chautauqua course of reading on Christian zeal?
Does it tend to increase one’s interest in Christian and Church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
work?’ I answered in substance as follows: ‘I am very glad
of the opportunity for saying, and saying confidently, that, judging
from what experience and observation I have had, as
also from the nature of the case, just as whatever is calculated
to enlighten and invigorate the mind, deepen, broaden, elevate
and strengthen character, to enlarge the soul and warm and ennoble
the heart, must tend to intensify Christian zeal, so the
Chautauqua course of reading and study, when conducted or
pursued in accordance with the projector’s idea, can not but
tend to have this effect—to deepen and to invigorate, by enlightening,
piety. Precisely what we need in our day is a more intelligent
piety—a broader and stronger Christian manhood. Our
piety generally is too narrow, or superficial, or feeble. We are
apt to build up too much on some one side. We are one-sided,
unsymmetrical, sanctified in spots only, as it were. We want
to be built out more on all sides, that we may be <i>thoroughly</i> furnished
unto <i>every</i> good work—that we may be fruitful in all directions.
Meantime, if the cultivation of such a thoughtful, intelligent,
reverent piety as the prayerful study of the works and
Word of God is calculated to promote, is not calculated to intensify
one’s interest in and zeal for Christ’s cause, it would be
interesting to know what could.’ Subsequently I dropped a
line to one of the members of a circle which I organized a
year ago—a bright, Christian young woman, who, though an
operative in the mill, yet clearly grasped the Chautauqua Idea,
and who, together with as fine a company of young men and
women as were ever grouped together for any cause, has most
enthusiastically and successfully pursued that idea for a year:—to
this young lady I dropped a line, submitting the question:
‘Do you find the C. L. S. C. helpful, or otherwise, to Christian
piety?’ Permit me to quote from her reply: ‘Do I love my
Savior, or his church, any less for what I have learned the past
year? No. A thousand times no. Jesus seems ever so dear
to me, as I look up into the starry heavens, and try to recall
something I have learned about those wonderful worlds. And
when I think of him who created, and who, by his almighty
power and wisdom controls and keeps them all in place; when
I think of him as my own kind Heavenly Father, though I am
poor, and lowly, and ignorant, and weak, and sinful, my
heart throbs with gratitude, love and praise—for he owns me as
his child! O! I wish I could tell you how happy I feel to-night,
my Savior seems so near and dear to me. My heart is full of
love to him and to his people; and I do want to do something
to help on his glorious cause. I am praying day by day that
he will show me my duty, and help me to do it; and I know
you will pray for me that I may be faithful and true.’ Does not
this testimony have the true ring in it? Does this look much
as though the C. L. S. C. had secularized the writer’s mind, or diverted
her energies from church channels? This lady, together
with several other members of that circle, is a devoted Sunday-school
worker. What is more, not a little of the glowing, enthusiastic
zeal expressed above, has been kindled and developed
during this very past year of C. L. S. C. reading and
study.”</p>

<h2 id="A_REUNION_AT_MILWAUKEE">A REUNION AT MILWAUKEE.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The five local circles in Milwaukee named Alpha, Beta,
Grand Avenue, Delta and Iota, recently had a grand reunion
on the occasion of the visit of the Superintendent of Instruction.
It having been announced in the papers that Dr. Vincent would
attend the Wisconsin conference and preach Saturday afternoon,
the circles decided to give him a reception. The committee
on invitation sent out about two hundred invitations
gotten up in a very tasteful and unique manner. The envelopes
were covered with autumn leaves of most delicate tints,
and contained each a square gilt-edged card, also covered
with leaves, bearing the monogram C. L. S. C. and the following
invitation: “You are kindly invited to meet Rev. J. H.
Vincent, D.D., Superintendent of Instruction of the Chautauqua
Literary and Scientific Circle on the evening of Saturday,
October 6, in the parlors of the Grand Avenue Congregational
Church. Reception, 6 to 9. Refreshments, 6:30.”</p>

<p>There was also a smaller card containing a neat little device
in a circle in the center, representing a hand holding a handkerchief,
and a request in the corner that this card be shown
at the door.</p>

<p>Besides these two cards there was a green leaf (artificial) in
each envelope for a badge, and a little printed slip of instructions,
directing each member to wear the leaf as a badge, and
explaining the Chautauqua salute to be given Dr. Vincent
when he entered the room.</p>

<p>The committees on decorations and on supper made diligent
preparations, so that when the time arrived parlor No. 1
was tastefully arranged with vines and flowers, while through
the open doors could be seen twelve tables in parlor No. 2 arranged
for an inviting feast. Among the decorations was the
banner of the class of ’86, made of maroon velvet bordered
with cream colored fringe, and bearing the class motto, in letters
cut from white felt, “We study for light to bless with light.”</p>

<p>Above the platform was a diploma granted to Mrs. William
Millard of the class of ’83, which arrived from Plainfield a few
hours before the reception, and was used as an object lesson
by the Doctor in his address. The entire event was most joyous,
this being the first union meeting of the circles, and the
first time many of them had ever met their revered leader.
Of his address, what can be said but that it was <i>like him</i>; full
of uplifting thoughts and helpful ideas of inestimable value to
all Chautauquans, and delivered in his delightful manner.</p>

<p>On Sabbath Dr. Vincent conducted a vesper service in the
Immanuel Presbyterian Church, the largest in the city. The
Chautauquans gathered in an adjoining room, and forming two
columns, headed by Dr. Vincent, marched into the audience
room where the central seats were reserved for them. Short
addresses were given by Bishop Hurst and Dr. Buckley, which,
with the impressive vesper service, made the occasion one long
to be remembered.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>From an able speech by Prof. H. A. Strong, before the local
circle of Erie, Pa., we clip the following: “Says one of the workers
and leaders around the C. L. S. C. camp-fire at Chautauqua:
‘I was in Missouri, March last, and was compelled to take a freight
train to make connection. As I entered the caboose I noticed
a little candle on a cracker-box on the side of the car. There
was a door on hinges made out of bits of leather, and a rough
button held in its place by a screw, closed the door. After the
train started, the conductor came in, and, after attending to his
duties, stepped to the box, turned the button, opened the door,
and took out a package of C. L. S. C. books, recognizable
as such anywhere, sat down on a bench and began working
with one of the Chautauqua text-books. Of course it was an
absolute necessity that I should make his acquaintance. I approached
him and asked him what he was doing. He said:
“A friend of mine in St. Louis called my attention to this Chautauqua
course of reading. I did not know what it meant, but I
knew I ought to read. So, finally, I joined the circle, bought
the books, and put them in this box. My brakemen read with
me. One of us keeps watch and the others read. Sometimes
we are switched off on a side-track, and then we make good
progress. Sometimes it is pretty hard work when we have an
unusually long run and much freight; but for the sake of the
help it is, I am going to hold on to it.” I felt like giving the fellow
a round of applause, all alone as I was in the car.’ Such an
experience of the C. L. S. C. can be duplicated over and over
again in the history of any class, and the simple truth is the
realization of the vision.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>In Canada the course of study for 1883-4 opened with a meeting
of C. L. S. C. workers and their friends in the lecture-room
of the Metropolitan Methodist church, Toronto, on the evening of
the 29th of September. After a few words of greeting from
Mr. Edward Gurney, jr., president of the Toronto Central Circle,
Rev. Dr. Thomas, pastor of the Jarvis Street Baptist Church,
spoke for a short time on the importance and value of a systematic
course of reading. The too common habit of desultory
reading, with its waste of time and mental enervation, came in
for a vigorous denunciation from the doctor. All reading, he
said, should be purposeful and systematic, and no reading can
be of any real profit that is not of that character. The C. L. S.
C. course answered two supreme questions that can not fail to
arise in the mind of any young man who is desirous to rise:
“What shall I read?” and “How shall I read?” In this age
of great intellectual power it was important that we should avail
ourselves of every opportunity for the better equipment of our
minds, so that we can use with precision the implements of our
profession or calling, whatever that may be. The multitudes
that are treading upon each other in the lower levels of life, are
the incompetent; no first-class worker in any line need remain
idle. The doctor also pointed out that this is a skeptical age,
and that we should be prepared to answer, if necessary, the reflections
that are being cast upon the foundations of our faith.
Before closing he said: “I want to declare my entire sympathy
with the work and purposes of this rapidly-spreading Chautauqua
tree, from the branchings of which thousands and tens of
thousands are gathering with delight and gratitude the most
luscious fruit. I thank God for this course of study, by means of
which the mind is led into the green pastures and beside the
still waters of literature. My mind has been stirred in the matter
as it would not have been if I had not examined into it
closely, and if I had not been profoundly impressed by the fact
that multitudes of our young people spend their spare moments
in reading pernicious literature in which the serpent has left
his slimy trail. I am going to join this class to-night for myself.”</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. Milligan, of old St. Andrew’s Presbyterian church,
followed with an earnest, practical address on “How to Read
Books.” He impressed upon his hearers the fact that books
are made for man, and not man for books, and that it is possible
for us to abuse the gift of books by becoming literary ceremonialists,
just as we can abuse any other good thing. Every
investment we make in relation to books should be made with
a definite purpose, and should make us richer. In our reading,
too, we should have something more ultimate in view than the
mere book; we should endeavor to ponder and reflect on the
subject which it treats. In this way we become thinkers, and
thinking becomes a necessity, and the mind and memory are
enriched and strengthened. Mr. Milligan expressed his hearty
coöperation and sympathy with the Chautauqua scheme, and
his pleasure that it is associated with the churches. A brief
round-table conference followed the addresses, in which thought
and experience were interchanged, and inquiries as to the
methods and progress of the Chautauqua Idea were answered
by the president, and by the Canadian secretary, Mr. Peake.
The local press is doing good work in bringing the advantages
of the scheme before its readers, and public interest is awakening
in all directions in regard to it.</p>

<p>C. L. S. C. class of ’87 sends out the following circular to its
members:</p>

<p><i>Beloved Friends and Co-Laborers</i>:—We greet you with joy
and gladness as we enter upon our four years’ college course
of reading and study. It is wisely selected and admirably
prepared for us in our home life. We that toil ten hours in the
shop, office, and store, with the never ending farm life and detail
of housekeeping, will know not a little struggle to command
forty minutes per day; but we need it and will do it. Mary A.
Livermore was forty-five years of age before ever attempting
public speaking, and in a decade was queen of the American
rostrum. Some of you at Chautauqua, last August, remember
the determined earnestness of Louise R. F. Jones. She writes:
“Aiken, S. C., Oct. 6. Have formed a local circle of thirteen;
first meeting last night at our house, two men, eleven women;
sent for our books yesterday. Have persuaded two persons in
Augusta, Ga., to join the C. L. S. C. In Langley, a small town
eight miles out, my ‘Hall in the Grove’ has been read, and a
circle is the promise. In Spartanburg, S. C., a circle is formed,
which, with Aiken, are the only two in the Palmetto State, so
far as known.” This Pansy Class of ’87 ought to graduate
at least 10,000, and with five hundred members like our South
Carolina friend, it would be accomplished. One of our class
travels, and in forty days visited over thirty newspaper offices,
begging editors to publish the C. L. S. C. leaflets, and securing
their sympathy. Another one, (just completing his three score
years) when on trains, goes from car to car, and politely and quietly
seating himself in front or back of the passenger, introduces
the “People’s College.” Our motto, “Neglect not the gift
that is in thee.” Inspired words! Let each one of us make
them ours in the best sense. Let us introduce circles as rapidly
as possible. Every day that passes now is forty minutes
behind, and it is difficult to catch up. It can be done up to the
first of January. Class writing paper has been prepared. Communicate
with either of the undersigned concerning it. Rev.
Frank Russell, Mansfield, Ohio, president Class of ’87. K. A.
Burnell, 150 Madison St., Chicago, secretary Class of ’87.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Rev. C. S. Woodruff, of Bayonne, N. J., class of ’82, was
present at Chautauqua this year, and passed under the Arches
with the class of ’83. On his return home he took occasion to
preach upon the subject of education, and mention the Chautauqua
plan particularly. As a result he has organized a local
circle of over sixty, and it is still growing. He says: “Every
pastor ought to visit Chautauqua. After being inspired he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
should spread his enthusiasm among all his people. Let
us cast out the devil of bad literature by giving the people good
reading.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Johnstown, N. Y., local circle, includes among its officers
a critic and an orthoepist—two excellent officers. Much
exact knowledge of pronunciation, spelling, use of words, and
forms of expression may be obtained at evening sessions, if
critical and wise persons are selected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is an energetic circle of twelve members at Shushan,
N. Y., the outgrowth of one member who began the readings
two years ago. There is something contagious in the C. L. S. C.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nothing could show better the peculiar work of the C. L. S.
C. than the following suggestive toasts offered at the “Opening
Day Exercises” at Meriden, Conn.; they were: “The C. L. S.
C., a beneficial force in the life of a business man; as a coöperative
with the duties of a school teacher; for young working
people, establishing an alliance between labor and culture;
as promoting Christian growth and culture; for the wife and
mother at home.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A very pleasant and inspiring piece of news comes from the
same circle. A young printer belonging to the circle became
so much interested in his studies, and so anxious for further development
that leaving his trade he has undertaken a college
course. The circle did a kindly act when they presented to
him that most necessary book for a student—Webster’s Unabridged
Dictionary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A local circle whose work is done by correspondence has
been started in the province of Ontario. There are but two
members, but a dozen might carry on the work with equal success.
For readers who are remote from the regular societies
this plan may be utilized and made a means both of culture
and of sociability.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A novel and exceedingly useful idea comes to us from Union
City, Indiana. On a neatly printed program there is given the
outline of the exercises for four months. The circle meets fortnightly,
and the date, place of meeting, exercises and participants
are given for eight sessions, so that there can be no mistake
or misunderstanding about the work to be done. The plan is
to be commended to all circles.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The class of ’85, C. L. S. C., held a meeting at the grounds
of the New England Assembly at Framingham and organized
by the election of the following officers: President, Rev. J. E.
Fullerton, of Hopkinton, Mass.; Vice Presidents, Miss Lena A.
Chubbuck, New Bedford, Mass., Alice C. Earle, Newport, R.
I., Miss Marcia E. Smith, Swanton, Vt., J. B. Underwood,
Meriden, Conn.; Secretary and Treasurer, Albert B. Comey,
South Framingham, Mass. Plans were suggested looking to
the social and other interests of the New England members;
said plans to be perfected as soon as the details can be arranged
by the executive committee. It is earnestly desired
that all persons in the New England States belonging to class
’85 will send their name and address to the Secretary. The
President cordially solicits correspondence from members of
the class upon matters pertaining to its interests.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the Silver Creek, N. J., <i>Local</i> we learn that the
meeting for re-organization of the C. L. S. C. has been held,
and that on October 8 the first regular meeting took place.
Several new members have joined the circle.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Spring Mills, N. J., though several members have moved
from the village, and a few have dropped the course, they report
a prospect of doubling their numbers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A circle of eleven members is reported at Greencastle, Pa.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Osceola, Iowa, has a circle of seventeen members, class of ’87.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some one inquires for a copy of “the rules of the C. L. S. C.
to guide in their meetings.” There are no rules to guide in the
meetings of the local circles. The wide diversity of circumstances
under which they exist would make a fixed organization
impracticable. What would fit the great circles of Troy, N. Y.,
and Pittsburgh, Pa., would be of little use to the small circle of
the village. The many plans and outlines of work in this department
are presented especially to guide new circles to the
plan best suited to their needs.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Montana has sent us reports of several energetic circles; the
one at Bozeman, of fifteen members, is the last reported.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A circle has been organized at Hood River, Oregon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Summer Assembly at Monteagle, Tenn., did some excellent
work in the interest of the C. L. S. C. Many circles are
being formed as a result of the efforts made there to spread information
concerning the methods and object of the organization.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One zealous C. L. S. C. worker writes us that while traveling
through the west in search of health she has succeeded in
making many think about the course, and has persuaded ten
to enroll for ’84. It is such individual effort that extends the
boundaries of our work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Mountain Lake Park, Md., Assembly there was formed
last summer a very interesting circle. The members are widely
scattered. They come from West Virginia, Maryland and
Pennsylvania, but have formed the “Mt. Lake Park C. L. S. C.,”
which they are keeping up while belonging to the local circles
at their homes. There are some forty-three members.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As an example of how the attention of your community may
be drawn to the C. L. S. C., we quote the following from the
Petersburg Va., <i>Mail</i>: “Everybody has heard of Chautauqua,
and the readers of <i>The Mail</i> have enjoyed several excellent
papers concerning that institution from the pen of Mrs. C.
D. Tinsley, of this city, who spent the summer there. But there
are many people who do not know that the C. L. S. C. is
spreading out its branches in all directions and offering very
fine advantages to people who desire to undertake a systematic
course of reading. The course extends over a period of four
years, and embraces religious, scientific, and general literature
of a substantial character. The books are cheap, and it is said
that one may cover the whole course by reading for forty minutes
each day. At the end of the fourth year, if the student
has gone over the ground, a diploma is given, bearing the
seal of the C. L. S. C. A number of ladies and gentlemen
of this city have handed in their names. The writer is
favorably impressed with what he has seen of it, and cheerfully
commends it to the public. All information required may be
had of Mr. C. D. Tinsley, of this city.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A member from Canada writes: “As one of the class of ’84—the
‘Irrepressibles’—and having caught the inspiration at
Chautauqua, I can hardly write or say anything strong enough
to express my admiration of the movement. I wish the officers
could do something for Palestine. When visiting it a year ago
I induced my dragoman, Herbert C. Clark, of Joppa, to subscribe
then and there for <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, as we were sitting
on the ruins of the old wall of Mount Zion, above the valley of
Hinnom. Mr. Clark writes me that he enjoys it exceedingly.
I was much of the time for ten days with Dr. Selah Merril, the
U. S. Consul, and his lady, who worthily represents the women
of America. There are many fine people speaking the English
language in Jerusalem and other points, who are cut off from
many of the advantages of our Christian civilization. Nothing
prospers under the administration of the stupid Turk, and literature
especially is discouraged. I believe the C. L. S. C. is
just what these good people need.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p><b>Vermont</b> (West Brattleboro).—For the past three years, there
have been at West Brattleboro, Vt., informal gatherings of from
eight to twelve members of the C. L. S. C., who called themselves
a “circle.” But until this year there has been no formal
organization. At the meetings subjects were taken up in the
way decided upon at the previous meeting. These meetings
were found to be of much profit and interest to ourselves. As
we learned to know and appreciate the “Chautauqua Idea,” we
began to see growth could not be expected without organization.
Accordingly a meeting was called for the evening of
September 20, to which all were invited, whether they proposed
to join or not. At this meeting the aims and methods of the C.
L. S. C. were fully discussed, and an organization was effected
under the name of the “Vincent Circle,” with a president and
secretary. There was also a committee for program chosen, to
serve for two months. It was decided to hold meetings once in
two weeks, at houses of the members. We are happy to say
that we start upon our new year with a membership of thirty-nine,
eighteen of whom are regular members, representing
classes ’84, ’86 and ’87. Nor is this all the gain. Another circle
has been organized, under the name of “Pansy.” This
circle is composed wholly of new members, who thought they
could work to better advantage separately. It has twenty-two
members. No doubt the secretary will report to you, as the
circle is very wide-awake, and means to profit by the experience
of the ’84s. It has been thought best to devote the time at the
meetings during October and November to Grecian history, as
that is the principal subject for study during those two months.
The following was the program for the first meeting, October 4.
The second meeting was similar in character:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Responsive Reading from “Assembly Hymnal.”</p>

<p>2. C. L. S. C. Song No. 6, from “Assembly Hymnal.”</p>

<p>3. Report of Secretary.</p>

<p>4. Introduction of the subject of “Grecian History,” by Prof. H. H.
Shaw.</p>

<p>5. Paper on “The Advantages of the Study of Grecian History.”</p>

<p>6. Instrumental Music.</p>

<p>7. Reading of Selections pertaining to Greece, from the Second Canto
of “Childe Harold.”</p>

<p>8. Blackboard Drill on “Outlines of Grecian History,” by Rev. C. H.
Merrill.</p>

<p>9. Question Box, Questions to be answered at next meeting.</p>

<p>10. C. L. S. C. Song No. 19.</p>

<p>11. Closing Prayer.</p>

</div>

<p>After the regular exercises, which began at 7:30, closing at
9, an hour was spent in a social way.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Massachusetts</b> (Lawrence).—Immediately after the Assembly
at Framingham, a meeting was called in the interests of the
Circle in one of our city churches, at which its purpose and
method of working were fully explained. Two circles were already
in existence, and with these as a basis we put in some
hard work during the month of September, securing to date
forty-two new members, with more to come. Two additional
circles have been formed, so that we now have four, with a
total membership of about one hundred. October 1, Opening
Day, was duly observed by a union Round-Table of all the
circles, and a large number of invited friends. A program consisting
of music and readings was given, all appropriate to the
occasion. We have engaged Prof. W. C. Richards for a course
of lectures in November, and shall have others from time to
time through the winter. We have also arranged for a monthly
union meeting, each local circle in turn conducting the exercises
for the evening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Massachusetts</b> (Franklin).—As the Bryant Bell at Chautauqua
rang out its call to study on October 1, the members of our
local circle assembled to celebrate the first anniversary of their
existence as a local circle. Complimentary tickets were issued
to their friends, and at the hour of opening the chapel was
filled, the audience numbering not far from five hundred.
Promptly on the hour, the new members of Class of ’87 (the
Pansy class) marched into the room, and taking position in
open ranks allowed the Class of ’86 to pass through; they taking
position on the right, opened ranks, and allowed the president
of the circle and the speaker of the evening to pass
through, receiving as a greeting the Chautauqua salute. The
program consisted of instrumental music, singing of selections
from Chautauqua Songs, an address of greeting from the president,
Rev. G. E. Lovejoy, the commencement address by Rev.
A. E. Winship, of Boston, and the recital of the anniversary
poem by Miss Laura Pond. The whole affair was a helpful and
enjoyable opening of the Chautauqua work for 1883 and 1884.
The circle starts upon its work with increased membership
and enthusiasm, and one and all are ready to say God bless the
originator of the C. L. S. C., and God speed the work in the
days to come!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Connecticut</b> (Meriden).—The Meriden branch of the C. L.
S. C., held Opening Day exercises; nearly every member was
present, together with a few invited guests, mostly those who
have especially assisted them in their work during the past
three years. The exercises were opened by the circle singing
from Chautauqua Songs a song of welcome, after which an address
of introduction of the several classes to the guests and a
synopsis of the work of the Circle, was delivered by the president,
who also took occasion to speak encouragingly to each
class, and referred to their several colors and what they symbolized.
At the close of the address a prayer of thanksgiving
was offered, when the company sat down to a banquet of good
things. After supper several toasts were offered and responded
to, and several testimonials of interest in the success of the
organization offered. The C. L. S. C. feel justly proud of their
success, and all who have taken time to examine into its aim
and the results accomplished, commend them highly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Connecticut</b> (Hartford).—Within a few days a general interest
has been manifested with regard to a C. L. S. C. circle in Hartford—more
than fifty having expressed their desire to become
members of the Class of ’87. Last year, however, Hartford
had but a few Chautauqua readers. Among them was a little
circle of five young ladies not long out of school. They found
the Chautauqua course just what they needed to give form and
direction to their studies, and they sat down to the table of good
things spread before them as to a mental banquet. A severe
bereavement met the circle in the loss of one of their members,
a young lady who had been an eager student and whose
enthusiasm had done much to help the circle. By her suggestion
Greek had been introduced into the course, and the Iliad
was being read in connection with the Greek literature. At
the last meeting before her death when it was proposed to omit
some of the less interesting portions, she said, earnestly:
“Don’t let us skip any. Let us do our duty.” The shock of
her death was such that at first it seemed that they could not
go on with their work, but the words of their departed friend
came back to them with peculiar meaning: “Let us do our
duty,” and with chastened hearts they took up their work again.
They did not find the course too laborious, but were able to
add to it the White Seal course and some valuable supplementary
reading upon the topics in question. Now, with undiminished
interest, they are ready to go on with the second year,
hoping that a large band will be ready to accompany them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>New York</b> (Johnstown).—A meeting for the reorganization of
Johnstown C. L. S. C. was held September 26, 1883. The
names of fifteen new members were enrolled; so we launch our
little craft of twenty-two members, with a prospect of taking an
occasional recruit as we journey on. We have decided to meet
every alternate week. At our next meeting, October 10, we
read an outline on Greek History, Vol. ii., Part vii., a paper on
American literature, and selections from <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Pennsylvania</b> (Erie).—The officers and members of the Erie
local circle of the C. L. S. C. presented a very elaborate program
at its opening session Monday evening, October 8, at the
Y. M. C. A. Hall in this city. The hall was densely crowded,
and the interest steadily increased to the close. The organization
was completed, and its roll bids fair, this season, to be
seventy-five strong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Delaware</b> (Wilmington).—Through the zealous efforts of the
pastor of Asbury M. E. Church, the Asbury local circle was
organized during September last. It has about thirty members.
Among the members is one graduate of the class of ’83. Considerable
interest in the course has been aroused through the
city, and there are more persons to join.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>District of Columbia</b> (Washington).—A meeting of the Banneker
Circle was held September 17 for reorganization and general
talk concerning the work for 1883-84. Quite a large number
of our members of last year attended, and from the number
of applicants for admission, it seems that we will be compelled
to abandon our idea of meeting from house to house of the
several members and meet at the church. It is exceedingly
gratifying to note the continued interest in the work. Our
meetings are held every Monday night. The pastor of one of
the churches in another section of our city, attended our last
meeting, in order that he might learn enough about the C. L.
S. C. to organize a circle among many of his members, who
seem anxious to join. We spent many pleasant and instructive
evenings last year over our work, and hope to realize as
much benefit from the studies of this year. Knowing of the
benefits of the C. L. S. C. we are always glad to help others to
join. One of our members has been influenced, through last
year’s work, to attend college.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Ohio</b> (Cincinnati).—The reception to the Class of 1883, of
Cincinnati and vicinity, took place on Friday evening, September
28. The spacious parlors where the reunion was held were
fragrant with flowers. A beautiful piece of crayon work—“Welcome,
1883,” with C. L. S. C. monogram—prepared by
the superintendent of penmanship of Cincinnati public schools,
together with a fine portrait of Dr. Vincent, held conspicuous
places. The following was the program:</p>

<p>Letters of regret were then read from unavoidable absentees.
Time and space will only permit of the publication of the
following letter, which is an embodiment of the sentiment contained
in the others:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hot Springs, Ark.</span>, September 24, 1883.</p>

<p><i>Rev. J. G. O’Connell, President C. L. S. C. Alumni Association of Cincinnati,
Ohio</i>:—Please accept my thanks for your very kind invitation to
attend the C. L. S. C. reception, Friday evening, September 28. The intervening
700 miles will prevent. But does not the Chancellor of the Out-of-Doors
University say that, “When the bell at Chautauqua rings on
memorial days, all true Chautauquans hear its echo?” And as this same
Chancellor teaches so diligently the superiority of mind over matter,
why may I not apply this teaching to my own case and say to you that I
will be with you in some sort of soul-telephonic manner, and hear your
speeches and join in your songs, and enjoy with you the feast of reason
and the flow of soul?</p>

<p>I am sorry I said I couldn’t go. I think you may expect me. I read
most carefully the report of Commencement Day, and welcomed (in my
heart) all the ’83s.</p>

<p>A popular writer in a most popular magazine says: “There are in
this life three stages of existence. The first, when we believe every
thing is white. The second, when one is sure every thing is black; the
third, when one knows that the majority of things are simply gray.”</p>

<p>Members of the C. L. S. C. have gone a step further than that. To
us, all the world has a <i>golden</i> hue. How <i>can</i> one fully understand the
meaning of the terms, “communion of Saints,” and “brotherly kindness,”
unless he has spent a season at Chautauqua <i>as a student</i>, in full sympathy
with the great work being done there? What grand opportunities
are there afforded for growth and symmetrical development of character.</p>

<p>Please tell your Alumni Association how glad I am to be counted one
of its members. I thank you again for your kind remembrance of me.</p>

<p>Wishing you a most joyous reunion, and uniting with you in warmest
love for our Alma Mater, I am yours sincerely,</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Hattie N. Young</span>.</p>

<p>The officers were elected for the coming year, and after a
handsome collation bountifully served, the society parted for
the evening, filled with additional enthusiasm for the success
of their Alma Mater. President, Mr. John G. O’Connell; Vice

<p><b>Illinois</b> (Mattoon).—This is the first year of the C. L. S. C. of
Mattoon. We organized the last of September, and have an
enthusiastic membership of over twenty. We take the lessons
as given in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, sometimes assigning the work
to individuals, and again we have general recitations. During
the winter we had an afternoon with Longfellow; also a lecture
upon the History of Greece, and one upon the Sun, with diagrams.
Most of us have completed the work for the year, and
have written the memoranda. Our meetings have been both
profitable and interesting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Iowa</b> (Anamoso).—Our C. L. S. C. circle was organized in
January, 1883, with a membership of nine ladies, all of whom
have taken up the four years’ course of study. The order of
exercises varies somewhat, but is always exceedingly interesting,
each study receiving due investigation and research. Generally,
however, our president assigns the different subjects to
the members on the preceding meeting, thus giving each leader
time to prepare questions which will bring out all the points of
interest in the lesson. Amid crowding duties we are glad to
note in our membership an increasing enthusiasm over the C.
L. S. C. work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Iowa</b> (Quasqueton).—We are a struggling little company of two
regular members of the C. L. S. C. We have not been lacking
in interest ourselves and are heartily in sympathy with the C.
L. S. C.; think it is a grand, good thing.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Missouri</b> (Kansas City).—The Kansas City local circle was
reorganized on September 25, and was ready to begin work
promptly the first week in October. We have at present
forty-four members. Our circle has propagated the Chautauqua
Idea, and sent off branches until now there are at least six
circles in the city, and about three hundred of our citizens are
reading the course.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><b>Missouri</b> (Independence).—A local circle was organized here
in September with forty-seven regular members. We have a
president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, and board of
managers. We meet every Friday evening, and thus far have
followed the conversational plan. All are interested, and the
Chautauqua enthusiasm has the true ring. Already the ’87s
are looking forward to the day when they will pass through the
Arches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A voice</span>: It furnishes a good channel for the expenditure of
money in connection with young people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: We ought to say in connection with that, it
builds up an individual library that acquires an individual preciousness;
when a man looks at it he is rich, for he owns books
bought himself. The square yards of books are not worth
much. The books that are mine are worth much to me.</p>

preaching and poor preaching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A voice</span>: It teaches that faithful labor, though in a very limited
degree, will be rewarded here and hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A voice</span>: And that it will accomplish a great deal of good in
addition to the reward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A voice</span>: It awakens latent energies in the mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A voice</span>: It makes the common people better critics.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: It makes what they would call where caste
prevails “common people” better critics. We have no common
people in this country. We are all kings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A voice</span>: It makes us understand better the Chautauqua Idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A voice</span>: It makes us patient in weakness and suffering.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A voice</span>: It helps us bear the burdens of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: In many places there is no social enjoyment
for those who do not dance. The C. L. S. C. gives us congenial
society. I have known many people where the habit of
dancing and card playing prevailed, to justify these indulgencies
on the ground that there was nothing else to do. In a few
such places the C. L. S. C. has turned the dance and the card
table out of doors. Of course some of you do not look at that
matter as I do. There may be some of you who dance or allow
your children to attend dancing school, and some of you
allow your children to play cards. I have avoided dogmatism
on all subjects where the Word of God does not come in as the
final authority. I never like to dogmatize about these things.
But I do believe that such is the condition of society to-day,
and such are the unseen perils of the day—perils always present—that
the family that can enjoy itself thoroughly in an intellectual
way, so as not to create a taste for the stimulating
power of the dance and the card table and of the theater is a
safer, and in the long run, a happier family than the family
otherwise controlled by so-called worldly tastes. [Applause.]
It becomes us to be very free from dogmatism about these
things, because we do not want to lay down laws that have not
been laid down for us; but if we can, let us substitute the influences
of the C. L. S. C. for these things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Written paper</span>: The C. L. S. C. gives new hope and courage
to those who have thought that the days for personal improvement
had gone by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: Dr. Wilkinson, in his address the other day,
made reference to the fact that I myself had never enjoyed
college opportunities. I did enjoy the very best academic opportunities
up to the time that I should have entered college, but
circumstances, which seemed very much like Providence, interposed
at that crisis in my life, where the question was settled
by three contingencies. I suffered from a bronchial affection,
and my friends regarded me in great peril physically. I
submitted three questions to three men after serious thought
and earnest prayer, and resolved to be governed by the decision
of the three men if they should decide in the same line.
To one, an able scholar and a most efficient preacher, and a
man occupying a high position in the church, I submitted the
question of my intellectual fitness, and gave him a long account
of my intellectual history. To another man, my father,
I submitted the financial part of the business. That was a
question that he alone could settle. To a distinguished physician,
one of the ablest in New York City, I submitted the question
of my physical health. Now, said I, if these three men
combine in their decision, I shall consider the question settled
in that way. If they differ, I shall consider it still open.
The decision of all three was quite in a given line, and I entered
very soon into the active ministry.</p>

<p>The fact that I lacked the <i>prestige</i> of the college was humiliating
to me to the last degree. It made me morbid for years.
I was too honest to impose on people, and therefore too likely
to betray myself where no good could come of it, and where
there was no necessity of it. But my humiliation led me to do
this thing: To turn my theological studies and the preparation
of sermons into means of mental discipline; to acquire the
habit of laying hold of a subject, and of holding on to it, and
persisting in holding on to it until I could master it, so that if I
did not have more than a smattering (and I did have a smattering
of Greek and Latin and Hebrew to begin with), I would
have the discipline of thinking on subjects and of tearing them
open on my own account. I tried to do that through all the
years of my active ministry.</p>

<p>I drew up for myself a sort of C. L. S. C. thirty years ago,
and took glimpses of all that the boy examines in college, so
that the C. L. S. C. of to-day developed out of it, and different
as it may be, it is the result of bitter experience and immense
effort, so far as I was personally concerned.</p>

<p>I really ought not to have mentioned these things to you. I
have never done so anywhere except to a limited circle of
friends. When I watch boys in college, their pleasures and
struggles; when I look at the buildings, at the bronze statue of
the first president of Yale, the libraries, the art department, the
scientific department; when I hear that old bell ring from day
to day, when I look on the <i>campus</i> and see the boys marching
or lounging, singing the college songs; when I see them striving
for preëminence in the athletic arena; when I remember that
certain prerogatives depend upon victory on this side or the
other; when I see old men who were students fifty or sixty
years ago, the oldest that are left, and see the joy that comes
from the inspiration of such memories, then I see that it is a
great thing to be able to give old people and every-day people
a touch of the joy and hope and memory that colleges alone
can give, and no one unless identified with such an institution
can feel.</p>

<p>It is for that purpose that we have the “Hall in the Grove,”
and the “Arches,” the “Memorial Days,” the “Badges,” the
“Diplomas,” etc. Privileges heretofore limited to college life
are thus and now guaranteed to the old and the young. This
is another benefit that comes from the C. L. S. C. [Applause.]
I should have taken a shorter time to tell it, but I could not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Written paper</span>: In accordance with your request for the
members of the Circle to remember each other at the throne of
grace each Sabbath afternoon, would it not be well to have a
set hour, say five o’clock, Sunday afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vincent</span>: The suggestion is a good one. We will call
five o’clock Sunday afternoon “Our Sacred Hour.” Mr. Bridge,
make an item for the columns of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>, that it
may reach all the members of the Circle.</p>

<p>As I said the other night, we are not all of the same way of
thinking, but we may all think upward, and whatever the degree
of our thought and the kind of our faith, if the look be
upward, there will be an uplift. If with sincere desire we pray
for others and seek God’s glory, he will lead us into all truth.
Let us appoint with your approval five o’clock Sabbath afternoon
for the uplook in order to uplift. Those who approve lift
your hands.</p>

<p>My friends, while the formal worship—the going aside and
kneeling down, and observing the form of worship—is very
useful, the idea of prayer is not limited to the place or particular
mode, or to the words you speak. Prayer is sometimes the
mightiest that leaps without words out of the inmost heart to
the highest heaven. Let us think a prayer wherever we may
be. Sometimes when people are too busy with their hands
and under the pressure of every-day labor to retire, and have
not words or place for the specific act of prayer, the uplift of
the soul, the upreach, is prayer that brings down abundant
blessings. Let it be so with us. Let us not be bound too much
by times and circumstances and words. Let us have the heart,
and let forms and words come as they will, and let us not
neglect times and forms and words.</p>

<h3>ONE HUNDRED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON “EASY LESSONS IN
VEGETABLE BIOLOGY.”</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By A. M. MARTIN, <span class="smcap">General Secretary</span> C. L. S. C.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>1. Q. How is the word Biology made up, and what does it
mean? A. It is made up of two Greek words—<i>bios</i>, life, and
<i>logos</i>, a discourse. It means the study of living things.</p>

<p>2. Q. What does Biology include in its survey? A. Both
animals and vegetables, and considers their forms and peculiarities,
the parts of which they are composed, their relations
to each other, and the uses which they serve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Q. What are the subjects of Physics and Chemistry? A.
The general forces of nature and the changes in non-living
matter.</p>

<p>4. Q. What is the teaching of the Bible and of all the religions
of mankind, the belief of the most eminent philosophers,
the doctrine held by the early Christian fathers, and maintained
by the majority of scientific and unscientific men as to
the difference between a living body and the same body after
death? A. That it arises from the union of matter and spirit.</p>

<p>5. Q. What is it that entitles any thing to be called a living
being? A. The presence of little particles of living matter
scattered through it.</p>

<p>6. Q. What does this living matter look like when seen
through the microscope? A. Like a little bit of jelly or albumen.
It is generally transparent; is neither quite solid or fluid.</p>

<p>7. Q. What is it called? A. It is often called protoplasm, or
first formation. It is also called by the better term bioplasm,
or living formation.</p>

<p>8. Q. What is said as to the resemblance of the particles of
bioplasm to one another, no matter where they belong? A.
They always look alike. There is no difference under the microscope
between the bioplasm of a blade of grass or a whale,
or an oak, a rose, a dog, or a man.</p>

<p>9. Q. What does chemical examination show as to all living
matter? A. That it is composed of the same elementary materials.
Oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen enter into
the construction of every piece of bioplasm.</p>

<p>10. Q. In what three different states do we recognize matter
in every bioplast, or living particle? A. Matter not yet alive,
but about to become so, called pabulum, or nutriment. Living
matter in the strictest sense, or bioplasm. Formed material, or
matter which was alive, but is so no longer.</p>

<p>11. Q. What peculiarity has living matter as to motion? A.
All bioplasm has spontaneous motion. Non-living matter has
inertia.</p>

<p>12. Q. What are the three kinds of motion of bioplasm? A.
Inherent motions of individual particles among themselves.
Constant change of shape. Wandering movements.</p>

<p>13. Q. What is the peculiarity of living matter as to the power
of nutrition and growth? A. The non-living increases in size
by external additions; but bioplasm selects appropriate material
from its food, or pabulum, changes the chemical relations
of this material, and appropriates it to its own structure in such
a way that it grows from within.</p>

<p>14. Q. What is the peculiarity of bioplasm as to reproduction
A. Bioplasm can generate or reproduce its own kind of
living matter.</p>

<h3>1.—AIM.</h3>

<p>This new organization aims to promote habits of reading and study in nature, art,
science, and in secular and sacred literature, in connection with the routine of daily
life (especially among those whose educational advantages have been limited), so as
to secure to them the college student’s general outlook upon the world and life, and to
develop the habit of close, connected, persistent thinking.</p>

<h3>2.—METHODS.</h3>

<p>It proposes to encourage individual study in lines and by text-books which shall be
indicated; by local circles for mutual help and encouragement in such studies; by
summer courses of lectures and “students’ sessions” at Chautauqua, and by written
reports and examinations.</p>

<h3>3.—COURSE OF STUDY.</h3>

<p>The course of study prescribed by the C. L. S. C. shall cover a period of four years.</p>

<h3>4.—ARRANGEMENT OF CLASSES.</h3>

<p><i>Each year’s Course of Study will be considered the “First Year” for new pupils</i>
whether it be the first, second, third, or fourth of the four years’ course. For example,
“the class of 1887,” instead of beginning October, 1883, with the same studies
which were pursued in 1882-83 by “the class of 1886,” will fall in with “the class of
’86,” and take for their first year the second year’s course of the ’86 class. The first
year for “the class of 1886” will thus in due time become the fourth year for “the
class of 1887.”</p>

<p>For the benefit of graduates of the C. L. S. C. who, being members of local circles,
wish to continue in the same general line of reading as undergraduate members, a
White Crystal Seal Course is prepared. This consists mainly of books belonging to
the current year’s study, but not previously read by the graduates. An additional
white seal is also offered to the graduates, the books for which are specified under
paragraph 4. Some of these books were in the first four year’s course, and are therefore
to be <i>re</i>-read. The payment of one dollar at one time entitles a graduate to the

<h3>6.—SPECIAL COURSES.</h3>

<p>Members of the C. L. S. C. may take, in addition to the regular course above prescribed,
one or more special courses, and pass an examination upon them. Pupils
will receive credit and testimonial seals to be appended to the regular diploma, according
to the merit of examinations on these supplemental courses.</p>

<h3>7.—THE PREPARATORY COURSE.</h3>

<p>Persons who are too young, or not sufficiently advanced in their studies to take the
regular C. L. S. C. course, may adopt certain <i>preparatory lessons</i> for one or more
years.</p>

<p>For circulars of the preparatory course, address Miss <span class="smcap">K. F. Kimball</span>, Plainfield,
New Jersey.</p>

<h3>8.—INITIATION FEE.</h3>

<p>To defray the expenses of correspondence, memoranda, etc., an annual fee of fifty
cents is required. This amount should be forwarded to Miss K. F. Kimball, Plainfield,
N. J., (by New York or Philadelphia draft, Post-office order on Plainfield, N.
J., or the new Postal Note, to be ready about September 1.) Do not send postage-stamps
if you can possibly avoid it. <i>Three</i>-cent stamps will not be received.</p>

<p>N. B.—In sending your fee, be sure to state to which class you belong, whether
1884, 1885, 1886, or 1887.</p>

<h3>9.—APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP.</h3>

<p>Persons desiring to unite with the C. L. S. C. should forward answers to the following
questions to <span class="smcap">Miss K. F. KIMBALL, Plainfield, N. J.</span> The class graduating
in 1887 should begin the study of the lessons required October, 1883. They <i>may</i> begin
as late as January 1, 1884.</p>

<p>1. Give your name in full.</p>

<p>2. Your post-office address, with county and State.</p>

<p>3. Are you married or single?</p>

<p>4. What is your age? Are you between twenty and thirty, or thirty and forty, or

<h3>LESSON II.—BIBLE SECTION.<br />
<i>The Bible from God Through Man.</i></h3>

<p class="center">By J. L. HURLBUT, D.D.</p>

<p>The Sunday-school teacher in his work uses one book, and
one only. To that one book he appeals as an authority; the
doctrines contained in that book he asserts as truth; the moral
system of that book he insists upon as the standard for man’s
obedience. It is therefore necessary to know concerning the
Bible:</p>

<p>I. The claims of the Bible believer.</p>

<p>II. The evidences supporting those claims.</p>

<p>I. There are <i>four claims</i> made on behalf of the Bible by
those who believe in it.</p>

<p>1. <i>Its Genuineness.</i> By this we mean that we possess the
book substantially as it was written. Not that we have an absolutely
perfect text, or that the translations represent precisely
the original, or that we know just when or by whom all the
books were written, but that the work has come into our
possession without serious mutilation or interpolation. We can
accept it as the Bible.</p>

<p>2. <i>Its Authenticity.</i> By this we mean that the book contains
the truth. Its records are trustworthy history; its reports of
discourses or parables or conversations give the substance of
their thoughts; its statements upon every subject can be depended
upon as honest and truthful.</p>

<p>3. <i>Its Inspiration.</i> By this we mean simply that this book
came from God. “Divine inspiration we understand to be an
extraordinary divine agency upon teachers while giving instruction,
whether oral or written, by which they were taught
what and how they should write or speak.” (Dr. Knapp,
quoted by McClintock and Strong.)</p>

<p>4. <i>Its Authority.</i> By this we mean that the Bible contains
God’s law, and was given to us as the standard in life. It contains
“the only rule, and the sufficient rule, for our faith and
practice.” No doctrine is to be accepted unless it is in accordance
with the teachings of the Bible, and no law is binding
which conflicts with the higher law of the Scriptures.</p>

<p>II. <i>The Evidences Supporting these Claims.</i> It is not necessary
to present the proofs of each claim apart from the others.
Those attesting the genuineness of the Bible will be given with
Lesson iv, “The Canon of Scripture;” but the other claims are
so linked together that the proofs of one are the proofs of all.
If the Bible can be proven <i>true</i>, its truth is of such a nature as
to show a divine original; and if it proceeds from God, it
comes as God’s law. Hence we present together the <i>Ten Evidences</i>
of its Authenticity, Inspiration and Authority.</p>

<p>1. <i>Its Adaptation to Human Need.</i> (1) We start with the proposition
that <i>there is a God</i>; a person who governs the universe;
not a mere personification of law or force, but a spiritual existence.
(2) <i>God has a Law.</i> If God has no law for man,
then for man there is practically no God. (3) <i>We have a right
to know that law.</i> What would be thought of a law-maker
with absolute power, who concealed his decrees, yet expected
his subjects to obey them, and punished them for disobedience?
(4) <i>We find just such a law as we need in the Bible</i>, and we
find it nowhere else, for it is not stamped into our consciousness,
nor is it written in nature. (5) We conclude then that
<i>the Bible contains the Divine Revelation</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Its General Acceptance.</i> The common consent of intelligent
society has accredited this book as authentic and divine.
(1) We find an <i>early acceptance</i> among those best acquainted
with its facts, and nearest to them; the Old Testament regarded
as divine among the Jews; the New Testament among the
Christians. (2) We find a <i>continuous acceptance</i> through all
the centuries since; at no time the chain of belief being broken.
(3) We find a <i>present acceptance</i> now; in this age of searching
investigation, when nothing is accepted on ground of tradition
only, the Bible has more readers, more students, more believers
in the intelligent classes than at any previous period of its
history.</p>

<p>3. <i>Its Characteristics.</i> The Bible contains four traits which,
taken together, distinguish it from all other books. (1) <i>Its
Variety.</i> Written at intervals through 1,600 years, by more
than thirty authors, in different lands and different languages,
it contains history, poetry, genealogy, biography, ethics, epistles,
doctrine, and many other classes of composition. (2) <i>Its
Harmony.</i> Underneath its variety of the surface there is a
harmony, so that its statements and its principles are nowhere
discordant. Contrast with this the discords of scientists. Could
we place on one shelf sixty-six books on astronomy, written
during sixteen centuries, by thirty writers, and find them harmonious?
(3) <i>Its Unity.</i> Amid all the different subjects of
the Bible there is one unifying purpose. It presents as its
theme <i>Redemption</i>, and every chapter in every book falls into
line in relation to that central thought. (4) <i>Its Progressiveness.</i>
There is a steady development of truth in Scripture, a growing
light through its centuries. We see the revelation beginning with
Adam, taking a step upward with Noah, another with Abraham,
again with Jacob, and so mounting higher in turn with Moses,
Samuel, David, Isaiah, Malachi, Peter and Paul, each on a
loftier platform of spiritual knowledge than the age before
him, until John crowns the pyramid of truth in his gospel and
the Apocalypse. Not all the earth can show another book besides
the Bible with all these four traits, which show the work
divine.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Harmony of its Relations.</i> The statements of the
Bible come into relation with facts ascertained in various
departments of knowledge; yet in none of these do we find
contradiction, in all an ever increasing harmony as our knowledge
grows. (1) <i>With Localities.</i> The Bible names more
than two thousand places in the ancient world; lands, rivers,
seas, mountains, towns, villages, brooks, etc., yet not a single
locality has been placed wrongly by the Scripture. (2) <i>With
Existing Institutions.</i> We find in the world such bodies of
people as the Jews, the Samaritans, the Christian church; such
services as the passover, baptism, the Lord’s Supper, etc. Take
away the Bible and none of these can be accounted for; open
the Bible, their origin is plain. (3) <i>With Historical Monuments.</i>
During the present century thousands of ancient inscriptions
have been brought forth and deciphered, and the
history of great empires has been written, bearing close relation
to the history of the Bible. But not a line of the Bible annals
has been discredited by these explorations, and many
Bible statements have been placed in clearer light. (4) <i>With
Science.</i> Though “the conflict of science and the Bible” has
been often referred to, yet the testimony of the best scientists
is that the opening chapters of Genesis are in substantial and
growing accord with geology; that the tenth chapter of Genesis
tallies with the latest conclusions of comparative philology;
and that modern astronomy furnishes the best illustrations of
the attributes of God as revealed in Scripture.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Fulfillment of its Prophecies.</i>—It is very evident that
no man, unaided by Divine wisdom, can know the future and
make prediction of coming events. Yet there is a book containing
many prophecies, which have been fulfilled to the letter.
(1) There are <i>predictions concerning places</i>, as Babylon,
Nineveh, Jerusalem, Tyre, Egypt, all differing in their statements,
yet all brought to pass. (2) There is a series of predictions
concerning Christ, beginning in Eden and extending
through the Old Testament, growing in definiteness as the hour
of fulfillment drew near, and all accomplished. Thus the New
Testament and the Old mutually prove each other.</p>

<p>6. <i>The Person of Christ.</i>—We find in the gospels four accounts,
by different writers, of one Person. They tell us that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he was at once God and man; that he grew up in a country
village, yet surpassed all the wisdom of the philosophers; that
he could create food, yet suffered hunger; that he could raise
the dead, yet submitted to be tortured and crucified; that he
was free from worldly ambition, yet became the founder of the
greatest kingdom earth has seen. The life, the character, the
personality, is so unique and original that no one could have
invented it. Hence the writers of the gospels must have drawn
their sketch from the life.</p>

<p>7. <i>The Candor of its Writers.</i>—The authors of these documents
write like honest men, telling their story plainly, without
partisan bias. They relate the sins of their heroes, Abraham’s
deception, Jacob’s double-dealing, Moses’ anger, David’s crime,
Peter’s denial, Paul’s quarrel with Barnabas. Their tone of
sincerity shows the truthfulness of the narration.</p>

<p>8. <i>The Elevation of its Teachings.</i>—Here is a book, written
in an age when even the most cultured nations worshiped
idols and held the grossest conceptions of God, with correspondingly
low ideals of morals for men. Yet in such ages, the
Bible presents a view of God to which the world has been
slowly broadening its vision; and a standard of character
which rises far above that of Plato, Cicero, or Confucius, and
is now adopted as the ideal manhood by ethical philosophers.
Whence, but from a divine source, came those lofty teachings
of the Scriptures?</p>

<p>9. <i>Its Influence Upon the World.</i>—What the Bible has done
shows the hiding of its power. (1) <i>See its effects upon nations.</i>
The lands where it is honored, America, England, North Germany,
are the three lands of most advanced civilization and
largest hope for the race. The lands where it is forbidden, as
Spain, or where it is unknown, as China, are those whose condition
is most hopeless. (2) <i>See its effects upon individuals.</i>
The people who study the Bible are not the drunkards, thieves,
criminal classes. Those who have the word in their minds and
hearts become purer, better, higher than others. It transforms
men from sinners to saints, and its influence makes earth a
picture of heaven. No false book, no deceiving book could
thus make the world better.</p>

<p>10. <i>Its Self Convincing Power in Experience.</i>—There is in
the consciousness of man a conviction that the religion of the
Bible rests upon a sound foundation. And he who puts the
Bible to the test in his own experience, who lives its life, and
follows its law, and enjoys its communings, finds an assurance
to the satisfaction of his spiritual nature, that this book contains
God’s message to his soul. Every Christian’s experience
is, therefore, a testimony to the truth and the inspiration of
Scripture.</p>

<h3>CHAUTAUQUA NORMAL CLASS—S. S. SECTION.</h3>

<h4>LESSON II.—THE SUPERINTENDENT: HIS QUALIFICATIONS,
DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITY.</h4>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">By R. A. HOLMES, A.M.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>In Lesson I we considered the place, purpose and prerogatives
of the Sunday-school. That it may keep to its place, accomplish
its purpose, and enjoy its prerogatives, efficient organization
is necessary. By universal consent the chief officer
of such organization is called “The Superintendent.” Experience
has proved that the character of the school and its
success or failure, as measured by the standards already given,
depend very largely upon the character of the superintendent
and his understanding of his work. This lesson will content
itself with answering briefly three questions:</p>

<p>I. <i>What are the Qualifications of the Model Superintendent?</i>—The
purpose of the school is the conversion and spiritual
education of those who are under its influence. This, therefore,
must be the purpose of the superintendent. As one can not
teach what he does not know, so he can not accomplish a purpose
unless he knows practically the steps which lead to its
accomplishment. The superintendent therefore must be (<i>a</i>)
<i>both converted and spiritually educated</i>. Conversion implies
oneness with Christ in will and desire. Christ’s will is the conversion
of the world. To effect it he instituted the church on earth.
The superintendent must therefore be (<i>b</i>) <i>a member of the
church, and a firm believer in it and its power</i>.</p>

<p>The church in its endeavor to accomplish its holy mission
has instituted the Sunday-school. Its special function is the
teaching of the word. Its great need is and has been competent
teachers. Their appointment and continuance in office
rests with the superintendent. The superintendent should
therefore be (<i>c</i>) <i>a good judge of human nature</i>; (<i>d</i>) <i>a person of
approved teaching ability</i>.</p>

<p>The school in active operation uses as its only text-book the
Holy Scriptures. The text-book is a difficult one. It deals with
the deepest problems of spiritual life and death. It is the offspring
of a remote day, and is filled with allusions to a state of
society and social customs entirely foreign to anything with
which we are familiar. A trained teacher in secular education
with no knowledge of this book may make utter failure as a
teacher of it. A knowledge of it in its entirety is absolutely essential
to the teacher in the Sunday-school. The superintendent
must therefore be (<i>e</i>) <i>a thorough and intelligent scholar in
Bible lore</i>.</p>

<p>The membership of the Sunday-school, aside from teachers
and officers, is largely composed of children and youth. By
nature humanity tires of monotony. Children are more restive
under monotonous routine than those who have won self-control
by culture. To keep in the school its children and youth,
to keep them interested in its purposes while in the school, and
to hold them untiringly to the true work of the school, needs
fertility of brain to give proper variety to the conduct of the
school, intelligence to discern the effects of all measures that
are adopted, tact to change and adapt to the ever varying conditions
of school life, and common sense to direct and govern
the whole. The superintendent must therefore be (<i>f</i>) <i>a person
fertile in expedients</i> and (<i>g</i>) <i>a person of intelligence, tact and
common sense</i>.</p>

<p>But often in the conduct of the school infelicities occur.
The different parts do not move in harmony with each other.
Cases of variance between pupils and teachers arise. Often
times the school suffers from financial lack. The chief officer
of the school is the one to whom all such matters come for final
adjudication. The superintendent therefore must be (<i>h</i>) <i>a person
of good executive ability</i>, that with firm, strong hand he may
hold each part of the system of which he is the center revolving
in its own orbit, never flagging, never tiring, never ceasing to
do its own part in the work, never clashing with any other.
Such are some of the principal qualifications of the superintendent.</p>

<p>II. <i>What should be his personal character?</i>—In general, all
that is suggested in the foregoing outline as to qualifications.
But our requirements must not end there. A man may be a
so-called Christian and yet be far from possessing the character
which is an essential to the Sunday-school superintendent.
He may be a church member, and be even less than a so-called
Christian. He may be a good judge of human nature, and yet
himself a poor illustration of it. He may be possessed of fine
teaching power, and yet misuse it. He may know the Bible as
well as Erasmus, and yet be like Erasmus, the subject of
Luther’s keen reproach of being everything in word, and nothing
in deed. He may be all we have described, and yet lack
in character.</p>

<p>The superintendent therefore should be pious, “having reverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
for God, and for religious duties.” He should be devout,
that is, should carry into daily life the active expression
of his piety. This would forbid sudden anger, inconsiderate
levity, trifling with Scriptures, by thoughtless quotations, and
all outward conduct that does not comport with true consecration.
He should be honest, truthful in word and act, humble,
loyal, and scrupulously observant of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>His constant motto should be as he daily studies to build
character in himself and others, “Study to show thyself approved
unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed.”
Let the student make for himself an outline of what the superintendent
should be in character.</p>

<p>III. <i>What are his duties?</i>—They are four fold. (1) To his
church. (2) To his pastor. (3) To his teachers. (4) To his
pupils.</p>

<p>His duties to his church are plain.</p>

<p>1. <i>He should attend the regular services of the church regularly.</i>—This
can admit of no negative. He should do it for its
effect on himself. He should do it as an encouragement to his
teachers. He should do it as an example to his pupils.</p>

<p>2. <i>He should impress habitual church going as a duty upon his
teachers and pupils</i> from the desk in the Sunday-school room,
and should use all means to effect the object.</p>

<p>3. <i>He should contribute regularly and uniformly to all the benevolent
objects</i> which the church presents as worthy of Christian
liberality. The reasons for this are too plain to need mention.</p>

<p>4. <i>He should urge to the same duty the teachers and pupils of
the school</i>, that they may each do their part, no matter how
small, in the work of Christian benevolence.</p>

<p>5. <i>He should contribute of his means as God prompts</i> him to
the support of his church, and not measure himself by the
standard of proportionate values. He should also teach the
same duty in his school.</p>

<p>6. <i>He should be loyal to his own particular church</i>; should
know its particular beliefs; should pray for its particular welfare;
and fearlessly do whatever lies in his power to promote
its purity and peace.</p>

<p>II. <i>His duties to his pastor.</i></p>

<p>1. Is that of <i>Coöperation</i>. The pastor and superintendent
should know each other’s plans and purposes thoroughly. The
pastor should always be able to feel that in his superintendent
he has one upon whom he can depend, who will aid him in his
work; share with him a certain portion of the duties devolved
upon him, and in all possible ways be like Aaron and Hur,
hand upholders in the fight against Amalek.</p>

<p>2. That of <i>Allegiance</i>. The pastor is the one man of all the
church upon whom all eyes are fixed. Among his multitude of
acts, some will be misunderstood. Among the multitude of
tongues some will be captious and critical. A spark may kindle
a conflagration. The superintendent owes it to church and
pastor to be loyal to his pastor and render him the knightly
service which the king could expect from the lord. He should
also teach the same duty to teachers and pupils in the school.</p>

<p>3. <i>He should be his Pastor’s Index Rerum</i>; not his mentor,
but his reference, to which he can turn for information concerning
affairs in that portion of the church represented by the
school. Sick children to be visited, poverty to be helped with
true charity, anxious souls looking for the Savior, these and
many similar are within the superintendent’s knowledge oft
times, when unknown to the pastor. To bring them to the pastor’s
knowledge is an evident duty.</p>

<p>4. <i>That of Harmony.</i> The pastor and superintendent should
agree. The school should have no plans or methods contrary
to the pastor’s desires. Church and school should walk the
same path, and in it go hand in hand.</p>

<p>III. <i>His duties to his Teachers.</i> While these are many we
mention but five, and these without discussion, leaving the student
to fill up the outlines.</p>

<p>1st. <i>Supervision of Work.</i> 2d. <i>Personal and close Acquaintance.</i>
3d. <i>Frequent Visiting.</i> 4th. <i>Individual Coöperation.</i>
5th. <i>A Weekly Teacher’s Meeting.</i></p>

<p>IV. <i>What are his duties to his Pupils?</i></p>

<p>1st. <i>To know each one personally.</i> It is the measure of the superintendent’s
power. 2d. <i>To visit them at their homes</i>, or to
insure a visit by their teachers. It is his chief means of knowledge
concerning them. 3d. <i>To review their knowledge of the
lesson</i> regularly, from week to week, and at the quarter’s end
to conduct a thorough and systematic review of the quarter’s
teaching. 4th. <i>To urge them to all of the various duties</i> which
are required of one in the Christian life. 5th. <i>To aid their
home training</i>, or supplement it, in providing suitable methods
for using their spare time. 6th. <i>To set before them the constant
example</i> of a pure and holy life.</p>

<h3>THE C. L. S. C. PLAN.</h3>

<p>No organization that has appeared in the past fifty years has
been more favored than the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific
Circle. From the first the surroundings have been such
as to aid its growth. Eminent educators and literary men
pronounced their blessings on its head the day it was born.
Thousands of people shouted its praises to the echo, in the
grove at Chautauqua, as soon as they saw what it was and
heard its name. Chautauqua had a history of five years to
place behind the C. L. S. C.—a history of enterprising investigation
in the fields of science and philosophy, Biblical literature,
church and Sunday-school work, and moral reforms. It
was five years of hard work to popularize useful information on
all these lines of thought. This was a good beginning for the
C. L. S. C., and right here it started. With the summer meetings
at Chautauqua it has been associated during these first five
years of its history. The C. L. S. C. Commencement exercises
are held in the Hall of Philosophy, in St. Paul’s grove, at
Chautauqua, and from thence the diplomas are sent out to the
graduates all over the world.</p>

<p>It never was the design of Dr. Vincent or Mr. Lewis Miller,
the founders of Chautauqua, that all the work of students should
be pressed into the compass of three weeks of meetings in
August, but rather that Chautauqua should be carried into towns
and cities, into homes and offices and workshops all over the
land. When the C. L. S. C. appeared and its curriculum was
announced with the promise that every person who should
complete the four years course of reading in ancient and modern
history and literature, the sciences, philosophy and art,
would graduate and receive a diploma signed by the officers of
the C. L. S. C., the idea was easily carried abroad. The press
of the country was ready, as we now see, to assist. The plan
was written up and philosophized upon from the beginning;
but more than this was needed to insure success. To make the
Chautauqua Idea as practical in a town five hundred or a
thousand miles away as it was at Chautauqua was a hard task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
to perform; but when it was decided that the <i>individual</i> could
enroll his name in the C. L. S. C. office and pursue his studies
at home, or when traveling, by devoting forty minutes a day to
his books, and could fill out examination papers at the end of
each year, the practicability of the plan was admitted by everybody.
The organization was simple, the working of the system
has been almost perfect, and each succeeding year has witnessed
a marvelous growth; classes ranging from 7,000 up to
14,000 members have been enrolled from year to year until the
present outlook is more encouraging than all the past.</p>

<p>The local circle has come to be an important factor in the
working of the organization. Men are clannish, and in the
work of education the world has always recognized the social
element as a powerful agency. It was natural that in the C. L.
S. C. men and women, who had no scruples on the question of
the co-education of the sexes, should come together and effect
local organizations, elect their officers and do their work methodically,
under the inspiration of one another’s presence. Just
as in raising a building ten men are stronger than one man, so
in a town or city ten persons will lift up the Chautauqua Idea
in more homes and attract the attention of more people to it
than one person possibly can. “In union there is strength,”
and while the practical working of the “local circle” is to
be seen in the growing intelligence of its individual members,
it is a fact that through the local circle the C. L. S. C. is taking
hold of the people in all parts of our land, and thus demonstrating
that the founders of Chautauqua have inaugurated an educational
system which has the merit of being a “Home College,”
whose privileges may be enjoyed by all classes and conditions
of people. While it is not sectarian or even denominational,
it is Christian, and carries correct ideas of God and the
Bible, of Jesus Christ and redemption, of the Holy Ghost and
Christian life into every reader’s mind and into every family
where the course of study is received.</p>

<h3>MARTIN LUTHER.</h3>

<p>Our heritage of civil and religious liberty is an outgrowth of
the Reformation, begun in the fifteenth century. By common
consent the Protestant churches confess indebtedness to Martin
Luther, the principal agent raised up by God for the deliverance
of his people. We gladly join our brethren of a free press
and the heralds of a free gospel, in making some mention of
this fourth centennial day. Want of space must greatly abridge
the tribute we would bring, and forbids any attempt to weave
such fitting chaplets as other hands will certainly bring to the
altar.</p>

<p>Four hundred years ago to-day, November 10, 1483, Martin
Luther was born in Eisleben, Saxony. The great German reformer,
whose words shook the world, and whose power, after
centuries, is felt by millions indebted to him, was of humble
origin, his parents being peasants of the poorer class, but religious,
honest, self-respecting people. He refers tenderly to
them, and says: “In supporting their family they had a hard
and bitter fight of it.” His own privations and hardships in
early life were met with something of the heroism and persistence
of endeavor that marked his later years. In school,
though a sprightly lad, full of fun and frolic, and often corrected
for his faults by a severe master, he was yet a diligent
student, eager for communion with all truth. His ambition and
thirst for knowledge led him gracefully to accept what was unfavorable
in his circumstances, yet not passively or without
methods of improving them. The spirited youth, with some
others under like pecuniary embarrassments, rather than leave
school, for a time sought bread in the neighboring villages, and
found way to the hearts of their benefactors by singing at their
doors. The songs of the boys seem to have been offered and
accepted as a remuneration for the material aid they needed,
and thus the depressing sense of mendicancy was not so
seriously felt. He earned his master’s degree when yet
young, having by his proficiency in both classical studies and
philosophy attracted the attention of some scholarly men. He
left school with honors, but not happy. Soon after began the
great struggle of his eventful life. On a careful introspection
he found in his quickened soul cravings that human knowledge
could not satisfy. Educated a Catholic, and observant of all
their rites and ceremonies, but finding little comfort in them, in his
unrest and almost despondence, he entered a monastery, thinking
by fastings, penance and prayers to find relief for a
wounded conscience. The way to him was dark; the conflict
terrible; the unhappy monk knew of sin, but not the Savior.
The day of his deliverance was at hand, though for a time he
saw but the dawn. With the Bible found in his cell as his almost
only guide, he at length clearly apprehended the way of
salvation by faith alone—believing he was justified. The
change was great, and the whole tenor of his after life confessed
it. The strong, earnest, cultured man, rejoicing now in the
gospel liberty, himself baptized with the spirit and fully consecrated
to work for others, was a fit instrument for inaugurating
any needed reformation. Led by the spirit and ever true
to his convictions, he was soon, though wishing to avoid the
issue, in open conflict with the Papal authorities. How bravely,
and with what results the battle was fought, is well known. It
was an open, manly fight. Any disguise with him was simply
impossible. He never masked his own position, nor sought to
flank that of the enemy. The warfare, on his part, was honorable,
but the shafts he forged were pointed, and hurled with
tremendous force. His multitudinous disquisitions, essays and
replies came in quick succession, as the exigencies of the controversy
called for them. He wrote, any reader will say, rapidly,
from the fullness of his mind and heart; and very few
authors have left on their works so strong an impress of their
own personality. He is perhaps best known in his “Table
Talk.” There is a freshness in these off-hand sayings that is
charming, and quite disarms criticism. His greatest gift to the
German people was his faithful translation of the Bible into
their vernacular, and his commentaries that are still held in
high esteem. The reformer’s influence, great while he lived,
has increased immensely during the four centuries. As a
biblical critic and expositor his ability is now recognized by the
general church. He held to the spiritual and supernatural in
religion, but recognized the human as well as divine factor in
the books of the Bible, and in that, too, the church is in sympathy
with him.</p>

<h3>THE TEMPERANCE QUESTION.</h3>

<p>Of this question it is the political aspect which at the present
time is most prominent. It is becoming a grave, disturbing
force in our politics. Viewing the temperance cause in the
light of political action, it is clear that it is advancing, and that
those who have the cause at heart have reason to thank God
and take courage. No little chagrin was felt when it was
known that the noble action of the people of Iowa a year ago,
in voting for constitutional prohibition, was, owing to a technicality,
of none effect. But again in that great state the battle
has been fought; this time in a different way. The Republican
party there had the wisdom to champion the prohibition measure;
this plank was squarely inserted in the party platform, and
in the campaign recently closed it was the leading issue. We
have the result of the election, and it should give the friends of
temperance encouragement and hope. A second time this
righteous principle has triumphed. The Republican party has
won the day, and if its avowed purpose is redeemed in the State
of Iowa, the sale of strong drink will soon be made a crime.
We turn to the state of Ohio, and here, too, we see sure tokens
that the temperance cause is moving forward. The confession
comes from prominent politicians, that if, in Ohio as in Iowa,
their party had adopted prohibition it might have been better.
This was not done; but the question in the late election was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
submitted to a popular vote and the result, all things considered,
is most encouraging. Some sanguine people may
have had faith that the prohibitory amendment would be carried,
but perhaps the number was not large. That it received
the great vote it did in a state where the liquor interest is of such
magnitude and so strongly intrenched, is something to cheer
and make thankful the hearts of good people.</p>

<p>One does not need the vision of a prophet to see that the
day of the triumph of prohibition in our country is coming on.
The right is to win. The time is in the not-distant future when
state laws and state constitutions will say that men shall not
make their living by pandering to the depraved appetite of fellow
men. The rum-seller’s business will be made illegal and
criminal. Even those who are looking forward to the prohibition
of the liquor traffic by the national constitution will not
long be called fanatical and visionary. But meanwhile other
work for temperance besides that looking to this condition of
things, so much to be desired, should not be neglected. Personal
effort to preserve the youth and reclaim men is always
demanded. People are clearly in error who say: “Prohibition
or nothing.” Laws whose aim is the curtailing of liquor selling,
should be sought, enacted, sustained and enforced as better than
none at all. Until we can have prohibition, let us have as
stringent restrictive enactments as possible. It is a short-sighted
view of things which prompts such a sentiment as this:
“If we can not have prohibition, let us have free rum.” The
adage of the “half-loaf” and the “whole” is full of sound
wisdom. We can but think there are earnest temperance men
who make a grave mistake. Prohibition—unquestionably the
true measure to apply to the liquor traffic, and for whose adoption
we should persistently work—fills their minds and hearts.
They bend their energies to secure this. But for other legal
measures, falling short of this desideratum, and aiming only to
restrict the wretched traffic, they have no support. Everywhere
restrictive liquor statutes are seen very imperfectly executed for
want of interest and determined effort on the part of temperance
people, whose rigid enforcement would work a grateful
change in our communities. If the law says that the saloon
shall not be opened on Sunday; that it shall be closed at a certain
hour of the night; that intoxicants shall not be sold to
youth under a certain age, or by any provision looks to the
diminution of the great curse of our people, it should be regarded
as good so far as it goes, for so much of prohibition as
it contains, and should have the support of good citizens,
though their hope looks and their labors are directed to the
total prohibition by law of the sale of strong drink as a
beverage. To make the best and most of what we have is the
true policy in every issue of life. If we can not have prohibition
now, we can see that our laws are enforced. When they
are thoroughly enforced, we will be much nearer prohibition.</p>

<h3>AN EXTRA DAY IN THE CALENDAR.</h3>

<p>“There is an island off the coast of New Zealand where the
day of the week changes. There Saturday is Sunday, and
Sunday, Monday. When Sunday noon closes, Monday noon
begins. A man sits down to his dinner Sunday noon, and
it is Monday noon before he is done eating.”</p>

<p>A correspondent sends us the above statement and asks, is it
correct? We answer: Not to the islanders, who, as ourselves,
have but 365 solar days in a year. But to a stranger coming there
on his voyage round the world, who has 366 at his disposal, it
is true. He has one day to spare, has no name or place for it
in the week, and just drops it out of his reckoning, as though
it had never been. The explanation is simple enough, even
for the young. The revolution of the earth on its axis, from
west to east, once in 24 hours, gives the sun an apparent motion
round the earth from east to west. To us the sun rises and
sets. The succession of day and night is just the same as if
the sun really went round the earth. As the sun’s apparent
motion is from east to west, a man traveling eastward, at whatever
speed, will see the sun rise, reach the meridian, and set,
a little sooner each day than the day before. So the time indicated
by his watch, and that by the sun will differ more and
more as he goes on; and what he gains each day in time will
evidently be to a solar day, as the distance traveled is to the
earth’s circumference. One degree east will make a difference
of four minutes, fifteen degrees an hour, one hundred and
eighty degrees twelve hours. Having reached the one hundred
and eightieth meridian, his chronometer and the sun are
just twelve hours apart, so he changes his reckoning, to avoid
confusion, and at noon Sunday calls it Monday. The correction
is of course too much, but if he waits till beyond that time it
amounts to more than half a day, and is constantly increasing.
If the error is to be corrected all at once—and this is the only
way that is found practicable—it should be done when it
amounts to half a day. When he has completed the circuit of
the earth a whole day will have been gained. If another man,
from the same place of departure, go west, or with the sun,
he will lose a day, and the two meeting would be, if neither
had changed his reckoning, two whole days apart—yet each
had the same number of hours and minutes. He who had the
greater number of days had them just so much shorter. There
is, of course, no reason in the nature of things, why the days
of the week should be changed on the one hundred and eightieth
meridian rather than elsewhere. There must be some point
from which longitude is reckoned, and to avoid confusion English
and American navigators agree on Greenwich, near London,
and their nautical charts, almanacs, etc., are arranged accordingly.
If they had taken as their starting point Washington,
the one hundred and eightieth meridian would have been
west of where it is, the number of degrees between the places.</p>

<p>Three hundred thousand voters in Ohio declared themselves
in favor of constitutional prohibition at the election in October.
The moral force of that vote is tremendous. Never before did
the Prohibitionists, who believe in carrying their cause into
politics, act more wisely than when they compelled an old and
powerful political organization to take up their cause and plead
for its success—“wisdom is justified of her children.” If they
did fail the effort was a great success, as is every action for a
good cause. When the dominant political party shall adopt
prohibition as one of the chief planks in its platform it will hold
the Christian and temperance voters in its ranks, but when it
throws this cause overboard these people will think seriously of
turning their political machinery upside down.</p>

<p>Mr. V. C. Dibble expresses these sensible views on a live
question in a recent number of the <i>Journal of Education</i>:
“The objection to classical culture rests upon the assumption
that it is not practical; an assumption which, although not uncommon,
is nevertheless incorrect. There is no issue between
classical education and that which is practical. The only education
worthy of any serious advocacy is the practical—that
which is adapted to the condition of its subjects, and which will
prepare them for the real work which life will demand of them.
Education is in fact life begun.”</p>

<p>The paper on which the United States currency is printed is
manufactured at Dalton, Mass., and the Boston <i>Herald</i>, in a
recent issue, gives the following particulars: Eighteen or
twenty Treasury girls, who earn $3 a day, count the sheets, examining
each one closely, and rejecting all imperfect ones. An
automatic register at the end of the machine registers every
sheet as it is cut off and laid down. The register man takes
them away in even hundreds, and they are immediately counted
in the drying room. In all the various processes of finishing
every sheet is counted, and they are again counted on their receipt
at the Treasury Department in Washington. The great
protection of the government against counterfeiting lies in the
paper here made. The distinctive feature is the introduction
of colored silk threads into the body of the paper while it is in
the process of manufacture. They are introduced while the
paper is in the pulp, and are carried along with it to the end of
the machine, where it is delivered as actual paper. This has
been more fatal than anything else to the professional counterfeiters.</p>

<p>The political work during the past month has been a contest
in several states for state officers. Massachusetts has attracted
the attention of politicians everywhere, because General Butler
was the most conspicuous figure in the campaign. He was a musical
candidate. Editors of political papers never failed to criticise
him and to praise him. He mixed up with schools, charitable
institutions, moral reforms, and the industries of the state.
He has been defeated by a heavy majority, and Mr. Robinson,
the Republican candidate, elected over him. It is now predicted
by the wise ones that this will close General Butler’s race for
the presidency, but this may prove to be false, because all ordinary
rules fail when applied to an abnormal character like
General Butler. He rides the stormiest sea of any man in
American politics.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Concerning candidates for the Presidency, all aspirants seem
to be using a kind of tactics that will keep their names out of
sight, while they gather all the strength possible for the coming
struggle. In late years a number of eminent men have run
well in the newspapers and in political street talk, but when
the votes were counted in the National Convention they failed.
Senator Don Cameron is in Europe, and rumor says he will remain
there till late in the summer of 1884. Ex-Senator Conkling
has lost his political influence, and Senator Logan is obliged
to share the political fortunes of his party in Illinois with
Secretary Robert Lincoln. This trio, Cameron, Conkling and
Logan, who were mighty forces in the last National Republican
Convention, will not be able to dominate the action of their
states in the next campaign for the Presidency. Perhaps, as
one result, the voice of the people will be more potential, and,
in such a case, correct ideas of government will triumph.</p>

<p>Ready made houses is an important branch of manufacturing

where a large establishment is located for the production of
these knock down houses, and he says that few have any idea
to what extent this business has been carried in Waterville and
its neighborhood, or to what perfection it has been brought.
In the establishment to which we refer dwelling houses are made,
like boots and shoes, in any quantity, and of any size or style,
and for any market in the wide world. Not long since this
concern received a single order for fifty houses for Cape May,
to be delivered speedily and in complete finish. These houses
were to be, not sheds nor shanties, but regularly ordered dwellings;
and they were made accordingly and so delivered, and
contain hundreds of occupants at this moment. An order will
be received for a $50,000 hotel, or an ornate, French-roof, cottage
for a fine country estate, and these as easily and expeditiously
furnished as an ordinary boarding house for a country
village, or a barn for a ranch in Kansas or Colorado.” This
would be a good plan for persons to adopt who contemplate
building cottages at Chautauqua. Try it.</p>

<p>The <i>Deaf-Mute Advance</i> comes to our table once every
week, from Jacksonville, Ill. As the name indicates, it is published
in the interest of deaf-mutes, and is doing much to inspire
with a desire for education the class of people to whom it
ministers. In a late number the editor says: “A young lady
from the country came to Danville some days ago, driven by a
green boy, who had his first view of town life. She had occasion
to go to the Deaf and Dumb Institute, and the boy, when
he went home, said he saw the people there ‘winking at each
other on their fingers.’”</p>

<p>Mr. Moody successfully opened his great mission in England
on Nov. 4. Four meetings were held, each of which was attended
by from 4,000 to 6,000 persons. The iron hall built for the occasion
proved to be complete in all its arrangements, affording
seating room for 5,800 persons. All around on the sides of the
hall appropriate texts were displayed, such as “God is Love,” and
over the platform, “We pray you in Christ’s stead be ye reconciled
to God.” Mr. Sankey sang with customary effect. Mr.
Moody’s powerful addresses showed that he had not lost his
hold on the people. At the close of the evening meeting a
man in the hall shouted out that Mr. Moody’s last mission in
London had been a failure. Mr. Moody answered by calling
for volunteers to come out boldly on the Lord’s side, whereupon
about three thousand men arose <i>en masse</i>. The incident
caused much excitement.</p>

<p>The first number of <i>The Outlook</i>, the paper published in the
interest of the class of ’84, is out. It is a stirring little sheet,
brimming over with class news, class gossip and class enthusiasm.
The ’84s are especially fortunate in having such an editor
as Mr. Bridge to lead them. This little quarterly will undoubtedly
do much toward awakening the class and making their
closing year even more brilliant than their beginning. Let every
member subscribe.</p>

<p>A novel and entertaining exhibit was held in Paris in October.
It was called “The Exposition of the Incoherent Arts,”
and was arranged by and contributed to by young artists.
Such a collection of absurdities is rarely seen, this one being
on a much larger scale than those in previous years, and those
who attend go to laugh. It is necessary to be a Frenchman
and a Parisian to thoroughly appreciate all the happy hits and
plays upon words, but even a foreigner can find food enough
for laughter. The proceeds of the exhibition are for the poor
of Paris, and it is expected that it will net quite a good sum.
The exhibition abounds in pictures of the realistic school. For
instance, where there is a figure wearing a shoe it will very
likely be a genuine shoe attached; or hair will be stuck on instead
of painted, suns and moons be represented by gold and
silver paper pasted on, and one painting gives a ship sailing
along accompanied by fishes, the fishes being two or three regular
dried herrings glued to the canvas. One of the most
prominent pictures is a portrait of the lecturer and critic, M.
Henri de Lapommeraye. The hair and mustache, the eyeglass,
the book just laid down, the letter he is reading, and the glass
of sugar and water at hand, are all real objects attached to the
picture, and of course, stand out most “naturally” from the
canvas. No. 85 is entitled, “Poem of a Pig.” It is a very
striking geometrical fantasy, the five different handlings of
plain geometrical figures giving a pig drama in five acts. First
act, pig strolling along seeking whom he may devour; second
act, a sudden noise startles him, he scents the wind; third act,
feeling he is pursued, he turns his head; fourth act, a knife
shines in the air, he guesses, he flees; fifth act, fate is fate, and
the beast sees heaven. No. 167 is “A Wild Pansy” (study of
flowers). One forgets that “<i>une pensée sauvage</i>” can also
mean a savage thought, and the surprise comes in to find the
flowers of the picture are a fierce young boy and a scared-looking
cat, and the boy is murdering the cat by running a spear
through its neck. These are but samples of the whimsicalities.</p>

<h3>THE SUN.</h3>

<p>On the twenty-first day of this month, in our latitude, occurs
the shortest day in the year. The sun rises at 7:20 and sets at
4:37, making the day’s length 9 hours, 17 minutes. This is
also the day on which properly our winter begins. The sun has
reached the winter solstice, his most southerly point, and now
begins his journey northward, causing the days to grow gradually
longer.</p>

<h3>THE MOON.</h3>

<p>The moon’s phases occur in the following order: First quarter,
on the 7th, at 6:38 a. m.; full moon on the 13th, at 10:20
p. m.; last quarter on the 21st, at 3 a. m., and new moon on the
29th, at 7:51 a. m., Washington time (or, according to the
“new reckoning,” eight minutes and twelve seconds later in
each case). The moon approaches nearest to the earth on the
12th, at 10:24 a. m., and is farthest away on the 24th, at 10:12
a. m. Its greatest altitude in this latitude will be on the morning
of the 14th, when it will be 60° 53′ above the southern point
of our horizon.</p>

<h3>MERCURY</h3>

<p>Will be evening star during the entire month. But it matters
little, so far as seeing it with the naked eye is concerned, until
near the close of the month, whether it be morning or evening
star. On the 1st it sets at 4:35 p. m., and is then too near the
sun to be seen. On the 30th it sets at 6 p. m., a few minutes
before the moon, and about 5½° south of the latter body. On
the 31st it sets at 6:03 in the evening, about one and one-third
hours later than the sun, and 1½° north of where the sun disappears.
On both these evenings, and for several days both
before and after these times, this planet is visible to the ordinary
eye, and by its bright white light is readily recognized.
Although visible several times each year, it is a remarkable
fact that it has been seen by comparatively few persons. In
the higher latitudes it is much more difficult to see than in the
lower, and the atmosphere of some parts of Europe is very unfavorable
for its observation.</p>

<h3>VENUS</h3>

<p>Will also be evening star throughout the month, setting on the
1st at 5:36, and on the 31st at 6:36 in the evening. It is at its
greatest distance from the sun at 2 p. m. on the 12th. By far the
brightest star in the west after sunset, a failure to recognize it
would be almost impossible. It is the <i>Hesperus</i> of the ancients.
On the evening of the 31st it is about seven degrees
south and a little west of the moon.</p>

<h3>MARS</h3>

<p>Will be the morning star, rising at 9:45 p. m. on the 1st, and at
7:51 p. m. on the 31st. From the 1st to the 23d it will have a
direct motion, that is, a motion from west to east, of 11 minutes
and 18 seconds of arc; on the 23d, it will be stationary,
and from the 23d till the end of the year it will have a retrograde
motion, that is, from east to west, of one minute and
forty-two seconds of arc. About nine o’clock on the evening
of the 18th, it is north of the moon 8° 18′.</p>

<h3>JUPITER,</h3>

<p>King of the planets, will also rank as morning star. On the
1st he will rise at 8:33, and on the 31st at 6:23 in the evening,
and like Mars will maintain nearly the same position in the
heavens during the whole month, his motion being 9′ 22″ retrograde.
On the 16th, at 9:51 p. m., he will be 5° 43′ north of
the moon. The moons of Jupiter can be readily seen with a
telescope of moderate power, or good opera glasses.</p>

<h3>SATURN,</h3>

<p>Though properly an evening star, shines from “dewy eve till
early dawn,” rising on the 1st at 4:27 p. m., and setting next
morning at 6:47; and on the 31st rising at 2:21 in the afternoon,
and setting the following morning at 4:42. His motion
will be 9′ 9″ retrograde, and on the 12th at 7:53 p. m., he will be
55 minutes north of the moon. The rings of Saturn are an object
of great interest to every observer and the present is a favorable
time to see them in great splendor, though the view in
December 1884 and 1885 will be still finer.</p>

<h3>URANUS</h3>

<p>Begins the month by rising at 1:02 a. m., (thus putting himself
among the morning stars), and at the close of the month at
11:11 p. m. His motion, which is direct, but only 1′ 42″ in
thirty days, seems slow enough, but when we reflect that he actually
travels an average absolute distance of over thirty million
miles a day, we can but wonder at his terrific speed. He
is located about two degrees southeast of <i>Beta Virginis</i>, and
“can be seen with the naked eye, if one knows where to look.”</p>

<h3>NEPTUNE,</h3>

<p>The most distant of the planets, rises on the 1st at 3:30 p. m.,
and sets on the 2d at 5:26 a. m., and on the 31st rises at 1:31
in the afternoon and sets the following morning at 3:25. His
motion is retrograde, and amounts to 2′ 34″ for the month.
This planet is of no special interest to the ordinary reader,
as “to recognize its disk with ease,” requires a magnifying
power of three hundred or upward.</p>

<h2 id="C_S_L_C_NOTES_ON_REQUIRED_READINGS_FOR_DECEMBER">C. S. L. C. NOTES ON REQUIRED READINGS FOR DECEMBER.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>EASY LESSONS IN VEGETABLE BIOLOGY.</h3>

<p>It will be observed that many of the words and expressions used
by Dr. Wythe in his “Lessons” are pronounced and explained in the
“Glossary and Index.” Where such explanations and pronunciations
occur, of course no notes have been prepared.</p>

<p>P. 12.—“Albumen,” al-buˈmen. The word is derived from <i>albus</i>, the
Latin word for white. Albumen forms a part of all animal fluids and
solids. The white of an egg is almost pure albumen. In the vegetable
world it is the food laid up for the nourishment of the embryo around
which it lies.</p>

<p>P. 13.—“Slide.” A small slip of glass about three inches long by one
wide. It is intended to place objects on which are to be examined under
the microscope. The “cover” here referred to, is a square of very
thin glass, which is placed over the object to hold it in place.</p>

<p>“Capillary attraction,” căpˈil-la-ry. When a capillary (hair-like) tube
is dipped into a liquid, there is an attraction between the solid and the
particles or molecules of the liquid which causes the latter to rise in the
tube if it wets it, or to sink if it does not.</p>

<p>“Heated stage.” The simplest means for heating the stage or slide
upon which an object is placed, is by a small alcoholic lamp placed at
the corner of the stage.</p>

<p>P. 15.—“32 deg. F.” 32 degrees on the Fahrenheit thermometer.
This scale, invented in 1714, by Fahrenheit, is commonly used in England
and America, although the centigrade scale (where the distance
between the boiling point and zero is divided into one hundred parts)
takes its place largely on the continent, and in most scientific works.</p>

<p>P. 18.—“Amœba,” a-mœˈba. Readers who live in warm climates
will have no trouble in finding the <i>amœba</i> attached to the stems of
plants or floating in pools of stagnant water. To find a specimen in December
in temperate latitudes will be more difficult, but by collecting
grass and stems of water plants, with water from a pool, and keeping
them in a warm room for a time, specimens may be obtained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 22.—“Cinchona,” cin-chōˈna. The tree from which the well
known drug, Peruvian bark, is obtained.</p>

<p>“Quinine.” Kwiˈnīn is Webster’s preferred pronunciation, kwe-nīnˈ,
Worcester’s. Quinine is an alkaloid obtained from the cinchona bark.</p>

<p>P. 28.—“Nucleus.” The nucleus may be easily seen in a thin section
from an apple or potato, placed under a microscope.</p>

<p>“Mucilaginous,” mū-ci-lăgˈi-noŭs. Like mucilage.</p>

<p>P. 29.—“Silica,” sĭlˈi-ca. Flint or quartz.</p>

<p>P. 31.—“Tannin,” tănˈnin, or tannic acid. An astringent principle
found in nut-galls and the bark of many trees. If treated with ether a
solid is obtained which is soluble in water. It is used in tanning leather.</p>

<p>“Starch.” The grains of starch are easily found. Wheat, oats,
arrow-root, sage and tapioca all furnish excellent examples.</p>

<p>“Crystals.” Răphˈi-des is the name given by botanists to the little
crystals found in the tissues. A section of an onion will reveal them.
Also, the juice of the hyacinth.</p>

<p>P. 34.—“Cochineal Cactus,” cŏchˈi-nēal. The cactus from which
the cochineal insects, whose bodies are sold in the shops for a red dye,
are obtained. The plant is also called cochineal fig, and is raised with
as great care for food for the insect, as is the mulberry tree for the silk
worm.</p>

<p>P. 35.—“Vessels.” The “dotted” vessel, or duct, is a long, open tube
whose sides are marked by pores, or dots. A transverse section of a
radish will furnish an example. A fern will furnish an example of “reticulated”
cell; almost any common plant contains the “annular” and
“spiral” cells.</p>

<p>P. 36.—“Epidermis.” All varieties of cells will be found in the epidermis
together with the mouths, or stomata. For examination a layer
should be carefully removed with a razor or knife, a little water put on
it to prevent too rapid drying, and the whole covered by a thin glass.</p>

<p>P. 37.—“Volatile oil.” That which wastes away when exposed to
the atmosphere; as musk.</p>

<p>P. 39.—To prepare sections of wood for slides there is a very simple
instrument which may be made at home by any one possessed of a little
ingenuity. Let a block of hard wood be selected, one and one-fourth
inches square by two inches in length, its ends perfectly smooth. In one
end drill a hole one-fourth of an inch in diameter, lengthwise, one and
one-half inches. In the other end insert a common wood screw, its
point filed square, until it reaches the hole. In the side of the block,
one-half inch from the end in which the hole has been bored, insert another
screw, with square point; this is to be used as a clamp. To cut
the section take a branch the proper diameter, and which has been boiled
in water, place it in the hole, and clamp solidly with the screw at the
side. With a keen razor cut off the end even with the block. By
turning the screw in the end of the block the branch will be pushed forward
any distance desired, and the section can be cut by a sliding motion
of the razor across the stem. The slices should be removed from the
knife with a camel’s hair brush, slightly dampened, and may be preserved
in weak spirits. The work is, of course, very delicate, and requires the
skill and nicety of touch which only practice brings. To mount the sections
in Canada balsam, as Dr. Wythe advises, the object should be
placed exactly in the center of the slide, which must be carefully
cleaned from dust, and a drop of the balsam placed upon it; hold the
slide over a flame until the balsam spreads over the object. Air bubbles
should be broken with a needle. A glass cover, warmed, should now be
placed on the object and pressed sufficiently to remove the superfluous
balsam. The whole should be put in a warm place until thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>P. 42.—“Showers of blood,” or blood-rain. A shower of reddish
dust mixed with rain, which has been known to fall in several places on
the eastern coast of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>P. 42.—“Diatoms.” “They are found in great abundance in the mud
of rivers, lakes and ponds. They are also present in those deposits of
clay which once formed the beds of rivers and lakes, and which are now
dry. In order to procure the diatoms from these deposits, the earth or
clay should be well washed with pure water, and the deposit allowed to
settle and the water poured off. This may be repeated several times.
The deposit is then to be washed with hydrochloric acid, and when the
effervescence is over, the acid is poured off, and a fresh portion is added.
This may be repeated several times. When no action occurs by
its use cold, the deposit may be transferred to a watch-glass, and
kept over a spirit lamp, at a temperature of about 200° for three or four
hours. The deposit must then be well washed with pure water, and
will be found to consist almost entirely of diatoms.”—<i>Lankester.</i></p>

<p>P. 47.—“Fungi,” fŭnˈji. No class is so easy to study in the winter.
If fruit, bread and the like are allowed to mould, any number of interesting
objects will be found. In the woods fungi are to be gathered from
bark and old logs. Of these the peziza, or cup-moulds will be found
most pleasing. Lichens also abound, and numerous sections can be
made from them.</p>

<p>P. 62.—“Big Trees.” These Big Trees are Cedars (<i>sequoia gigantea</i>).
“Calaveras,” kä-lä-vāˈräs.</p>

<p>“Buds.” Many plants form their buds in the fall. A careful search
will reveal such for examination. The lilac and trailing arbutus form
their flower buds in autumn, and in vigorous plants a section of the bud
will show distinctly the flower stowed away for spring.</p>

<p>P. 63.—“Leaves.” “Opposite” leaves are seen in the chickweed
and fuchsia; “whorled,” in Prince’s pine; the “alternate,” in the rose
family. The arrangement of leaves on the stem has been reduced to a
science, called <i>phyllotaxy</i>.</p>

<p>P. 64.—“Bracts.” Seen in the camellia and strawberry. The white
portion of the calla blossom is a colored bract called spathe; also, the
“pulpit” of the common Indian turnip or Jack-in-the-pulpit.</p>

<p>“Sessile” leaves are seen in the upper leaves of the common primrose
and spring beauty. All plants of the violet and the rose families bear
<i>stipules</i>.</p>

<p>P. 65.—“Lanceolate,” as in the peach; <i>oblong</i>, the radical leaves of
shepherd’s purse; <i>cordate</i>, in the blood-root; <i>sagittate</i>, in the stem leaves
of shepherd’s purse; <i>ovate</i>, in chickweed and violet; <i>pinnate</i>, as in the
rose; <i>bipinnate</i>, as in the sensitive plant.</p>

<p>P. 68.—When the stamens and pistils are on separate trees or plants,
the fertilization is accomplished in various ways; insects or birds carry
the pollen in many cases, in others the wind wafts it.</p>

<p>“<i>Hypogynous</i>,” as in the cress, radish, cabbage, and other cruciform
plants.</p>

<p>P. 69.—<i>Perigynous</i>, as in the rose family; <i>epigynous</i>, as in the caraway,
celery, and parsnip.</p>

<p>P. 76.—“Labiate.” The word means lip-shaped, and the order is
named from the peculiar shape of the corolla.</p>

<p>P. 77.—“Composite,” or compounded; “Herbaceous,” her-bāˈshus.
Plants with soft stems which die every year.</p>

<p>“Coriander,” cŏˌri-anˈder; “Asafœtida,” ăsˈa-fĕtˌi-da.</p>

<p>P. 78.—“Papilionaceous,” pa-pĭlˈyo-nāˌshus. From the Latin for
butterfly.</p>

<p>“Tamarind,” tămˈa-rĭnd. A tree 60 to 80 feet in height, with dense
foliage. A native of Africa and India. Its pods are preserved and used
as a medicine, or as an article of diet.</p>

<p>“Senna,” sĕnˈna. A drug prepared from the dried leaves of the
cassia, a shrub raised in India and Nubia. A variety of cassia is found
in the United States, but its leaves are less powerful. “Acacia,” a-kāˈshĭ-a,
“Mimosa,” mī-mōˈsa.</p>

<p>P. 79.—“Ranunculus,” ra-nŭnˈcu-lŭs. The word means a little frog.
Pliny is said to have so named this species because many of its members
grow in water where frogs abound.</p>

<p>“Aconite,” acˈo-nite. A plant related to the Hellebores; the common
wolf’s bane, or monk’s hood.</p>

<p>“Cruciate,” kruˈshĭ-āt. The petals are arranged in the form of a
cross.</p>

<p>P. 80.—“Chimborazo,” chim-bo-rāˈzo. A peak of the Andes in
Ecuador. It is the sixth in height among the lofty peaks of the range.</p>

<p>P. 82.—“Floras.” The whole number of plants native to any section
forms its flora.</p>

<p>“Urticaceæ,” ur-ti-caˈce-æ. Nettles.</p>

<p>P. 83.—“Rhododendrons,” rhōˌdo-dĕnˈdron; “Azalias,” a-zāˈle-as.
These plants both belong to the order of heathworts or <i>ericaceæ</i>, the order
to which the huckleberry, cranberry, trailing arbutus, and other
well-known plants belong.</p>

<h3>BIOGRAPHICAL STORIES.</h3>

<p>P. 14.—This picture, West declared sixty-seven years after it was
painted, contained some touches that he never surpassed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 15.—“Camera-obscura,” cămˈe-ra obˌscūˈra. Literally, a dark
chamber.</p>

<p>P. 16.—“Parma.” A province in the north of Italy.</p>

<p>“Death of Wolfe.” This picture contained one feature which at that
period was entirely new. West used costumes in his picture which were
appropriate to the time and character. Before this the classical costume
was used on all occasions. It is said that Sir Joshua Reynolds, the
president of the royal academy before West, tried to dissuade him from
this innovation, but was the first to acknowledge his success.</p>

<p>P. 24.—“Gulliver,” gŭlˈli-ver. The hero of a satire, “Gulliver’s Travels,”
by Swift. He is represented first as a surgeon, and then as captain
of several ships. He takes voyages, during which he discovers many
strange countries, among them the country of the Lilliputs (lĭlˈli-pŭt), a
race of little men.</p>

<p>P. 29.—“Uttoxeter,” ŭksˈe-ter.</p>

<p>P. 34.—“Merry-Andrew.” One whose business it is to make sport
for others—a clown, a court fool.</p>

<p>P. 68.—“Oxenstiern,” ŏksˌen-steernˈ.</p>

<p>P. 70.—“Lutzen,” lootˈseen. A town of Prussia.</p>

<p>P. 72.—“Muscovy,” musˈco-vy. The former name of Russia.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>GERMAN HISTORY.</h3>

<p>P. 129, c. 1.—“Merovingians,” mer-o-vinˈgi-ans. The first Frankish
king of whom we have authentic accounts was Chlodio, who ruled about
the middle of the fifth century. His successor, Merovæus, gave his
name to the first <i>house</i>, or dynasty of the Franks; of him we know little
more than that he fought against Attila.</p>

<p>“St. Remigius,” re-mijˈi-us, or St. Remy, rehˈmeˌ. (439?-533.) The
Apostle of the Franks. When but a young man he was made Bishop of
Rheims. By his zealous work he spread Christianity widely through the
Frankish kingdom. A contemporary declares him to have been the
most eloquent man of his times.</p>

<p>“Rheims,” reemz. A city in northeastern France, whose bishops
date from the fourth century, and whose cathedral is one of the finest
gothic edifices in Europe.</p>

<p>P. 129, c. 2.—“Arian.” The religion of Arius, a bishop of the fourth
century, who held that Christ, though chief of created beings, was not
equal to God. A book lately issued by Appleton &amp; Co., “Arius the
Libyan,” will be found to be an interesting account of his life and doctrines.</p>

<p>“Paris.” The first account which we have of Paris is from Cæsar,
who visited it in the last century before Christ. It was then but a collection
of huts on an island in the Seine, and was called Lutetia.</p>

<p>“Poitiers,” poi-teerzˈ. A town of France, one hundred and eighty
miles southwest of Paris.</p>

<p>“Abderrahman,” äbd-er-rähˈmän; “Viceroy,” vīceˈroy. One who
rules in the place of a king; a substitute. “Caliph,” cāˈliph. The
successors of Mohammed were all called caliphs.</p>

<p>“Damascus.” Soon after the death of Mohammed Damascus was
captured by his followers and made their capital. Such it remained for
ninety years. On the fall of the Ommiyades, their successors, the Abbassides
chose Bagdad as their capital.</p>

<p>P. 130, c. 1.—“Islam,” ĭzˈlam. Meaning obedience, submission, is a
name given to the religion of Mohammed.</p>

<p>“Gregory I.” (540-604.) Born of a noble family and educated for
public life, he was made prefect of Rome in 573, but his strong religious
nature led him to give up his position, turn over his wealth to the
Church and become a monk. Through the fourteen years of his pontificate,
Gregory employed every means to purify and strengthen the
Church, sending missionaries into all parts of the world, combating
Arianism and rectifying many abuses.</p>

<p>“Augustin.” The Apostle of the English. A Benedictine monk at
Rome when chosen by Gregory I. to go on a mission to the Saxons.
He went to England about 597, was received kindly by King Ethelbert,
and allowed to preach through Kent. After a time Ethelbert adopted
Christianity and was baptized. This led to the complete triumph of the
religion throughout the kingdom. Augustin was made Archbishop of
Canterbury, and until his death had charge of the Church in England.</p>

<p>“Holy See.” A name given to the office of the pope, and also applied
to the pope himself, or his court. <i>See</i> is derived from the Latin verb
“to sit,” and literally means a seat, or site, hence a place where power is
exercised.</p>

<p>P. 130, c. 2.—“Asceticism,” as-cetˈi-cism. The practice common
among members of the early Church of withdrawing from all business
and society to devote themselves to a rigorous life of penance and self-denial.</p>

<p>“Vatican Hill.” The <i>Mons Vaticanus</i> of the ancient Romans,
from which the palace of the Vatican takes its name.</p>

<p>“Dacia,” dāˈci-a. A province of the Romans north of the Danube,
and comprising parts of the present countries of Hungary, Transylvania
and Roumania.</p>

<p>“Dalmatia,” dal-māˈti-a. A narrow strip of country lying along the
eastern shore of the Adriatic, now belonging to the Austro-Hungarian
Empire.</p>

<p>“Istria,” isˈtri-a. A peninsula, now of Austria, on the northeastern
coast of the Adriatic.</p>

<p>“The German Crown.” In 1806, one thousand and six years after
the crowning of Charlemagne, a league known as the Confederation of
the Rhine, and of which Napoleon Bonaparte was protector, was formed
between the central and southern German states. Its real object was to
aid France against Prussia and Austria. The king of Germany resigned
his crown then, and the empire came to an end.</p>

<p>P. 131, c. 1.—“Roland.” Roland, or Orlando, was the nephew
of King Charlemagne, brought up by him and trained to be a warrior.
He is the hero of one of the most famous stories of the middle
ages, “The Song of Roland.” Various authors have used this tale. The
<i>Orlando furioso</i> of Ariosto, and <i>Orlando innamorato</i> of Boiardo, are
prominent among these. In a metrical narrative the story was sung by
the minstrels of those times. According to this song Charles had been
seven years in Spain warring against the heathen, until there remained
but one king unsubdued, Marsilius of Saragossa. He had promised
homage, and the step-father of Roland, Ganelon, was, by Roland’s advice,
sent on an embassy to him. Ganelon was angry because Roland
had advised that he be sent, and in revenge betrayed to Marsilius the
pass through which the rear guard and most valiant portion of Charles’
army, under Roland would pass. Charles, with the body of his army,
passed through, and when Roland appeared with his twenty thousand
men, an army of four hundred thousand heathens attacked him. Roland
fought until only a fragment remained before blowing his enchanted horn
to summon Charles to his aid. Before his uncle could reach the pass
every man was dead. The Saracens fled back to Spain, but the king
pursued, completely defeating them. But the death of Roland robbed
the conquest of all its glory, and threw France into mourning.</p>

<p>“Paladin,” pălˈa-dĭn. A distinguished knight.</p>

<p>“Roncesvalles,” ron-thĕs-välˈyĕs. The pass in which Roland and
his band were destroyed.</p>

<p>“Otto the Great.” Otto I. (936-973.)</p>

<p>“Ardennes,” arˌdenˈ. The forest of Ardennes lies in the northeastern
part of France, covering a portion of the department of the same name,
and extending into Belgium.</p>

<p>P. 131, c. 2.—“Frisian,” frisˈi-an. Belonging to the Frisians, a tribe
formerly living beyond the Batavi, but pushed to the borders of the
North Sea by the Franks.</p>

<p>“Aix,” āks. A town in southern France whose thermal springs
were known to the Romans.</p>

<p>“Alcuin,” ălˈkwin. (735-804.) His great reputation for learning
caused Charles to invite him in 780 from England, his native country,
to open a school in France. This institution is supposed to have been
the germ of the present University of Paris. Alcuin afterward opened
a school at Tours, which became very famous.</p>

<p>“Verden.” A town lying southeast of Bremen, in Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 132, c. 1.—“Haroun-al-Raschid.” See notes in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
for November.</p>

<p>“Bretons.” The inhabitants of Brittany, the triangular peninsula
which extends from the western coast of France into the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>“Almayne,” alˈ-main.</p>

<p>P. 132, c. 2.—“Eginhard,” ĕgˈin-hart. He had been a pupil of
Alcuin, and by him was introduced at court. Eginhard’s history of
Charles and his accounts of the Franconian kings have given him a permanent
place among the writers of the middle ages. See Longfellow’s
poem, “Emma and Eginhard,” in “Tales of a Wayside Inn.”</p>

<h3>NOTES ON GERMAN LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>It will be found helpful to read the extracts from German Literature
in connection with the “Outline of German Literature” in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
for November, thus fixing the period to which each author
belongs. Care has been taken in selecting the extracts to choose only
from those who are in the first rank, and omit all minor writers. The
selections are intended to show the style of each, and the lines of thought
which he followed.</p>

<p>P. 132, c. 2.—“Würtzburg,” wurtsˈburg. A city of Bavaria on the
Main, whose history dates back to the sixth century.</p>

<p>“Minster.” The word comes from the Latin <i>monasterium</i>, and is
applied to the church or chapel belonging to a monastery; also, as here,
to a cathedral.</p>

<p>“War of Wartburg.” In 1206 the landgrave, Hermann I., summoned
the poets of his nation to a musical tournament in the castle of Wartburg,
in the Thuringian Forest. The competition ran so high that it was
called the Wartburg war, and in 1300, a poem, “The War of Wartburg,”
appeared, celebrating the event.</p>

<p>P. 134, c. 1.—“Luther.” The value of Luther’s literary work can
not be estimated. As a poet, his hymns have won him a permanent
place. Beside his original verses, he re-arranged and set to music many
of the Psalms, thus really founding the church music of Germany. His
translation of the Bible must be counted his most important work; but
beside this he left a mass of sermons, theses, tracts and controversial
writings which, at the time of their writing, wielded wide influence.
These latter show most plainly the fiery spirit of their author, his clear
conceptions of truths, and his pure style. Special attention should be
called to his “Table Talk,” which contains numberless short and pithy
statements of his opinions, and to his Catechism on the Decalogue, Apostles’
Creed, and the Lord’s Prayer.</p>

<p>P. 134, c. 2.—“Nathan the Wise.” This was Lessing’s last drama, and
was written to show his own religious views and to advocate the wide
toleration in which he believed. The three chief characters, Nathan a
Jew, Saladin a Mohammedan, and a Christian are thrown together,
and their association causes a strong friendship in spite of their diverse
views. They practice the utmost charity toward each other. The story
of the “Three Rings” contains the point of the drama. It is taken
from an old Italian novel.</p>

<h3>READINGS IN ART.</h3>

<p>P. 142, c. 1—“Nicolo Pisano,” pe-sāˈno. (1200?-1278?) His architectural
works are also important, he having designed churches for Padua,
Venice and Florence, and a campanile for Pisa.</p>

<p>“Pisa,” peeˈsā. A city of Italy, west of Florence, on the river Arno.
Its cathedral contains much fine art.</p>

<p>“Siena,” sĭ-enˈnā. A city of Tuscany, south of Florence.</p>

<p>“St. Dominic,” dŏmˈĭ-nik. (1170-1221.) The founder of the order
of “preaching friars.”</p>

<p>“Bologna,” bo-lonˈyā. An Italian city at the foot of the Appenines,
and north of Florence.</p>

<p>“Andrea Orcagna,” or-kānˈyä. (1329-1389.) The son of a Florentine
sculptor who instructed him in art. His surname, Orcagna, is said
to have been a corruption of L’Archagnuolo (the Archangel). His
fame as a painter and architect was equal to that as a sculptor.</p>

<p>“San Michele,” mĭ-kaˈla. The churches of Italy are almost without
exception named after the saint to which they are dedicated, as in this
case, San Michele, after St. Michael.</p>

<p>“Giotto,” jŏtˈo. (1276-1336.) He was born near Florence, and
brought up a shepherd lad. While tending his sheep it is said that a
Florentine painter found him drawing on the surface of a rock, and was
so convinced of his genius that he took him to Florence to be educated.
His talent was so great that he was soon employed in the decoration of
the church at Assisi. The details of his life are not known except that
he traveled extensively through Italy, being employed in ornamenting
many prominent buildings. It is as a painter that Giotto is best known,
and as such he did much to awaken art from its unnatural and stiff forms,
and to introduce realism. “Campanile,” kăm-pa-nēˈla.</p>

<p>“Ghiberti,” gee-bĕrˈtee. (1378-1455.) He learned the trade of a
goldsmith, but at that time the goldsmith’s art included others, especially
designing and coloring. At first Ghiberti was a fresco painter, but was
called to sculpture by his success with the bronze doors over which he
spent most of his life. “San Giovanni,” jo-vänˈnee.</p>

<p>P. 142, c. 2.—“Donatello” do-nä-tĕlˈo. (1383-1466.) He was a
native of Florence. One of the Medici became his patron, and he was
enabled to apply himself to art. He was a painter of merit as well as
a sculptor, and the only one of the age worthy to be ranked with Ghiberti.</p>

<p>“Brunelleschi,” broo-nĕl-lĕsˈkee. (1377-1444.) Better known as an
architect than as a sculptor. “Zenobius,” ze-noˈbi-us.</p>

<p>“Lucca del Robbia,” del-robˈe-ä. (1400?-1463?) He was trained to
the goldsmith’s art, but took up sculpture. To him is attributed the interest
in porcelain which started in Europe in the fifteenth century. His
process of glazing was probably learned from the Saracens, and consisted
essentially in using stanniferous (containing tin) enamel. This rendered
the terra-cotta work permanent, and gave a white background.</p>

<p>“Uffizi,” oof-fēˈtsi. “A palace of Florence whose galleries are among
the best of Europe. It contains paintings of all the principal European
schools, and many famous statues. There are halls devoted to sculptures
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, drawings of the old masters, engravings,
ancient bronzes, medals, gems, cameos, intaglios, the whole
forming one of the finest collections in the world.” There is also a
library in the palace which is rich in manuscript and letters of Italian
writers.</p>

<p>“Verrocchio,” vāirˌrokˈke-o. (1432-1488.) Of the very little known
of Verrocchio, the most interesting fact is that he was the first to take a
mould of the human form to aid in designing.</p>

<p>“Leonardo da Vinci,” le-o-narˈdo dä vĭnˈchee. (1452-1519.) A native
of Florence. In youth he was recognized as an almost universal genius
and speedily surpassed all instructors. He became attached to the court
of Milan in 1483 as a musician and improvisatore, and remained there
until 1499, when he removed to Florence. About this time he was employed
in various cities as an architect and engineer. He went to France
in 1145 with Francis I., as court painter, and there died. As a sculptor
we have no remains of his work. Vinci was as remarkable a thinker as
artist. Hallam says of his literary fragments: “They are like revelations
of physical truths vouchsafed to a single mind. The discoveries
which made Galileo and Kepler and other names illustrious, the
system of Copernicus, the very theories of recent geologies are anticipated
by da Vinci, within the compass of a few pages.”</p>

<p>“Contucci,” con-tukˈche. “Sansovino,” sän-so-veeˈno. (1460-1529.)
Sansovino was a Florentine, and his early works were executed there.
Thence he went to Rome and worked, and in 1513 took charge of the
Holy House of Loreto, at which he worked until his death.</p>

<p>P. 143, c. 1.—“Loreto,” lo-rāˈto. “The Holy House, in which, according
to tradition, the Virgin Mary was born, the annunciation and
incarnation took place, and the holy family resided on their return from
Egypt. The legend is that the house was transported by angels in 1291
from Nazareth to the eastern coast of the Adriatic, and thence in 1294 to
the coast of Italy. It is a rudely built brick house, 13½ feet high, with
one door and one window.… The relics, treasures and offerings
of different pilgrims are numerous and valuable. The house is enclosed
in a marble casing, which is covered with exquisite sculptures.”</p>

<p>“Buonarroti,” boo-ōˌnä-rotˈee. (1475-1563.) A painter, sculptor,
and architect. He came from a family of high rank. His artistic genius
was early displayed, and he was put under masters to study. Lorenzo
de’ Medici, pleased with his ability, took him to his palace, where he
studied until his patron’s death in 1492. He was summoned to Rome by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Julius II., to design his tomb, and in 1508 he began the decoration of
the Sistine chapel. When seventy years old he was called upon to take
up architecture, and finish St. Peter’s, then under way. For the rest of
his life he was engaged upon this church, together with several other
buildings of Rome. Michael Angelo was not only an artist, but a writer;
his sonnets are among the best in any literature.</p>

<p>“Centaurs.” Fabulous creatures of mythology—half man and half
horse.</p>

<p>“Carrara,” kär-räˈrä. A city of northern Italy, which gives its name
to a chain of mountains belonging to the Appenines. They contain
quarries of fine and valuable marble.</p>

<p>“Giuliano,” joo-le-äˈno; “Lorenzo,” lo-renˈzo; de’ Medici, da mĕdˈe-chee.
A family distinguished in Florentine history, of which Lorenzo,
called The Magnificent (1448-1492), was the most famous member.
Giuliano, his brother, was assassinated in 1478, an attempt being made
against them both, instigated, some say, by Pope Sixtus IV.</p>

<p>“Modena,” modˈe-na; “Bagarelli,” bah-gah-rahˈlee.</p>

<p>“Padua,” padˈu-a; “Riccio,” retˈcho. (1480-1532.)</p>

<p>“Tatti,” tahˈtee. (1479-1570.) Also called Jacopo Sansovino, from
his master. Tatti was a Florentine, and worked in his native city and at
Rome until 1527, when he went to Venice; there he founded a school
and did much work.</p>

<p>“Mars.” The Roman god of war, corresponding to the Greek Ares.</p>

<p>“Neptune,” nepˈtune. In Roman mythology the god of the sea. The
Poseidon of the Greeks.</p>

<p>P. 143, c. 2.—“Pacher,” paˈker. He lived about 1480.</p>

<p>“Veit Stoss.” (1483-1533.) His early labors were in the churches
of his native city. The second period of his life was spent in Nuremberg
where many of his works remain. Of them it is said: “They are
distinguished by a tender fervor and grace, a mild softness of form, and a
clearly developed style of relief, with a great deal of life likeness.”</p>

<p>“Jörg Syrlin,” yŭrg seerˈlen. He lived in the latter half of the fifteenth
century.</p>

<p>“Riemenschneider,” reˌmen-schnīˈder; “Von Schrenburg,” fon
schrenˈburg; “Vischer,” fĭshˈer. He began his work in 1489, and died
1529.</p>

<p>“Chef d’œuvre,” shā-doovrˈ, masterpiece.</p>

<p>“Regensborg,” reˈgens-borg. The German name for Ratisbon, a city
of Bavaria.</p>

<p>“Apollo,” a-pŏlˈlo. One of the most popular of Greek divinities.
Numerous offices were filled by him; he was the god of song and music,
of prophecy, of punishment, of protection, and of the sun. Smith says
of him: “It may safely be asserted that the Greeks would never have
become what they were without the worship of Apollo.” And again:
“In him the brightest side of the Grecian mind is asserted.”</p>

<p>“Orpheus,” orˈphe-us. “Eurydice,” eu-ridˈi-ce. Orpheus was a poet
and musician of Grecian mythology. His lyre enchanted even the beasts
of the field, and the rocks were moved from their places at its sound.
His wife, Eurydice, died and was carried to Hades, but Orpheus followed
and by the music of his lyre won back his wife on condition
that he should not look upon her until they were past the bounds
of the infernal regions. His love overpowered him, he turned to see if
she followed, only to see her disappear. His grief, it is said, led him to
treat the Thracian women with contempt, and he was murdered by them.</p>

<p>“Maximilian,” maks-ĭ-milˈyan; “Innsbrück,” insˈbrook.</p>

<p>“Fontainebleau,” fonˈtanˌblōˈ. A suburb of Paris, famous for
its splendid palace. This palace was begun in the tenth century, and
has been added to, remodeled and ornamented by various monarchs
since. Its architecture is of all schools, its pictures, statues and books
invaluable.</p>

<p>P. 144, c. 1.—“Bernini,” bér-neeˈnee. He began work for the pope
at the age of eighteen, and spent several years on the churches and palaces
of Rome. His fame was so great that he was invited to Paris in
1665 to complete the Louvre; but his plans for this were never carried
out. His latter life was spent in Italy.</p>

<p>“Allessandro Algardi,” al-les-sanˈdro äl-garˈdee. (1598-1654.) “Puget,”
püˌˈzhaˌ. (1622-1694.) “Girardon,” zheˌrarˌdonˈ. (1628-1715.)
“Houdon,” ooˌdonˈ. (1741-1828.)</p>

<p>“Pigalle,” peˌgalˈ. (1714-85.) “Duquesnoy,” düˌkaˈnwäˌ. (1594-1646.)
“Schlüter,” schlĭˈter. (1662-1714.)</p>

<p>“Winckelman,” wĭnkˈel-män (1717-1768). A German archæologist.
His researches and writings stimulated the interest since taken in archæology,
and he is regarded as its founder. Also his theories of the
beautiful and “History of Art” opened a new field in German thought.</p>

<p>“Canova,” kä-noˈvä; “Pompeii,” pom-peˈyi; “Herculaneum,”
herˈcu-laˌne-um.</p>

<p>“Theseus,” theˈse-us. A legendary hero of Attica, of whom many
wonderful adventures are told. This story of the Minotaur (a monster,
half man, half bull,) is that Theseus was taken to Crete along with the
youths and maidens which were offered every year to the monster. The
king’s daughter fell in love with him and gave him a sword with which
he killed the Minotaur, and then escaped from the labyrinth in which
he was confined, by a thread which he had unraveled as he went in.</p>

<p>“Dannecker,” dänˈek-er. (1758-1841.) “Chaudet,” shoˈda. (1763-1810.)
“Thorwaldsen,” torˈwawld-sen; “Villa Carlotta,” vēˈlyâ car-lotˈa.</p>

<p>“Gutenberg,” gooˈten-bĕrg. (1400?-1468.) The reputed inventor of
printing.</p>

<p>“Mayence,” māˈyângs. The French name for Mentz, a city of Hesse
on the banks of the Rhine. “Leuchtenberg,” loikˈten-bĕrg.</p>

<p>P. 144, c. 2.—“Schadow,” shäˈdo; “Stettin,” stetˈteen. A town of
Prussia.</p>

<p>“Blücher,” blooˈker; “<i>Naïvete</i>,” näˈēv-tā, simplicity, ingenuousness.
“Rauch,” rowk; “Bülow,” büˈlo; “Scharnhorst,” sharnˈhorst; “Charlottenburg,”

<h3>SELECTIONS FROM AMERICAN LITERATURE.</h3>

<p>P. 146, c. 1.—“Whately,” hwātˈlĭ. (1787-1863.) Archbishop of

association with the “coat of many colors.”</p>

<p>“Purlieus,” pûrˈlūs. The outer part of the inn, here. The word
means <i>pure place</i>, and was first applied to that portion of the forest

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
